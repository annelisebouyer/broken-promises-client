		<p>Residents of the Gulf Coast from Louisiana to Florida were nervously awaiting the arrival of Tropical Storm Karen on Saturday, despite the system weakening slightly overnight as it churned close to the US coastline.</p><p>The ongoing government shutdown slowed preparations for the arrival of the storm, which will be only the second to hit the US during what has been an unusually quiet Atlantic hurricane season. The first, Tropical Storm Andrea, struck Florida in June. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Florida National Guard began recalling furloughed employees in recent days but bickering continued on Friday in Washington, even as the House of Representatives passed an emergency funding bill for Fema as the storm approached.</p><p>The governors of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida declared states of emergency in advance of Karen's arrival, allowing for the mobilisation of National Guard troops, while officials ordered evacuations in the coastal Louisiana parishes of Plaquemines and Grand Isle. </p><p>National Weather Service meteorologists, at work despite the shutdown, warned of a high risk of flooding and up to six inches of rain.</p><p>\"The wind speeds are down a little but this is still a strong tropical storm,\" said Dennis Feltgen of the National Hurricane Centre in Miami. \"Karen could have a very significant impact and we don't want anyone letting their guard down. Nobody should be taking this lightly.\"</p><p>He said the storm, with maximum sustained winds of 40mph, was expected to slowly skirt the Louisiana coastline towards the Mississippi River during Saturday, before making landfall in Alabama or the Florida panhandle.</p><p>In New Orleans, mayor Mitch Landrieu said he was confident local and state preparations were not hampered by the shutdown. </p><p>\"Resilient cities are cities where people know each other and check on each other and help each other out,\" he said. \"We don't want people to get overly anxious, but don't let your guard down and be ready. We ought to be okay in terms of life and personal property.\"</p><p>The Hurricane Centre had predicted a storm surge of up to 4ft from the Gulf of Mexico, but it also stressed the uncertainty of its forecast given the slow forward speed of the storm.</p><p>Most services and functions of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were suspended because of the federal shutdown, but the National Weather Service and its hurricane centre were deemed essential \"to protect life and property\".</p><p>Employees who must report to work, however, are not being paid â€“ seemingly a sore point for NWS forecasters in Anchorage, Alaska who released a weather bulletin on Friday with a coded message for politicians.</p><p>The first letter of each line of the official 5am discussion of weather in the south of the state spelled out \"Please pay us\", the message remaining online until managers spotted it and ordered its removal. A rewritten version was later posted in its place, but <a href=\"http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/10/04/20822490-secret-coded-plea-on-national-weather-service-site-please-pay-us?lite\">only after several media outlets had taken a screen-shot of the original.</a></p>
