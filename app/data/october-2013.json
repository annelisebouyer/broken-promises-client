    "body":"<p>David Cameron and Mark Harper, the constitutional affairs minister, can claim something in common. They were both taught at Brasenose College, Oxford, by Vernon Bogdanor, the professor of government, with whom they both disagreed but whose dream of a reformed British constitution, built around a more proportional electoral system, they may be about to realise.</p><p>Harper, the minister charged with guiding a referendum on a change to the voting system through parliament, says he personally opposes the proposed switch to the alternative vote (AV), arguing he fears the new voting system would make it more difficult to throw governments out.</p><p>Based in the Cabinet Office, there is no other Tory minister working in such proximity to Nick Clegg. Harper, a Eurosceptic and believer in first-past-the-post, admits cheerfully: \"If you had said to me six months ago I would be working very closely together with the leader of the Liberal Democrats on constitutional and political reform I would be somewhat surprised. But I have also been surprised that there is a real sense of a team inside government.\"</p><p>It is his task to steer through the Commons a bill introducing five-year fixed term parliaments, a referendum on introducing the alternative vote, a 10% reduction in the size of the house and the biggest changes to constituency boundaries since the 1920s.</p><p>It promises to be a stormy passage. Observers calculate that the boundary changes – built round equalising the number of voters in a constituency – could be worth an extra 20 seats to the Tories. Labour calls it gerrymandering, and will oppose the bill at second reading. Harper insists this is a redressing of a current unfairness in the system.</p><p>Bogdanor, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cac02290-a3e2-11df-9e3a-00144feabdc0.html\" title=\"in an important piece in the Financial Times\">in an important piece in the Financial Times</a>,  this week set out the importance of this bill: \"There is a temptation to believe that voters are being asked [in the referendum] to approve a mere technical change in the electoral system. Nothing could be more mistaken. The outcome will have massive political consequences. AV opens the door to a new political world in which coalitions become the norm, and single party majority government a distant memory. Defeat for AV could quickly end the coalition. But success would bind it together for a long time to come.\"</p><p>Since AV is a system in which voters can rank candidates by preference, it would allow the Tories and Lib Dems to put up candidates in every constituency, and ask supporters to give second preferences to their coalition partners – a natural way for the coalition to go through an election without a merger.</p><p>\"The key thing the current system delivers is that it gives voters that essential sanction which says: 'This government is no good and I want it out.' That is why I will be campaigning for a no vote,\" says Harper.</p><p>\"There is an additional argument about whether AV allows a coalition to move smoothly through an election period without everyone falling out with one another.\"</p><p>He denies it is contradictory to claim that coalitions are wrong in principle. \"This government was partly formed in response to the circumstances of the time. This was about two parties coming together to deal with the severe circumstances we found ourselves in, but that does not mean we think this is the right model in perpetuity.\"</p><p>As soon as the bill is passed, £5m spending limits will be imposed on each of the two designated campaign organisations and £500,000 for any third party campaigns. May, he says, is a legitimate date as 83% of the country will be voting anyway and the Electoral Commission appears to have dropped objections to combining local elections and the referendum.</p><p>A range of forces will be voting no, says Harper, including many Conservative party members, most Tory MPs, some Labour MPs and unions. On the yes side will be the Lib Dems and possibly Labour, but he describes Labour as \"all over the place on this issue\".</p><p>He is eager to challenge the assumption that the second part of the bill, redrawing the boundaries, should be detached from the referendum. \"Three things are going to happen. We are going to cut the size of the Commons by 7.5%. Secondly, we are equalising constituencies across the nations of the UK. Thirdly, the aim is to reduce the disparities in the size of seats so that no seats can be plus or minus 5% off a norm.</p><p>\"For the first time it will be an absolute requirement that no constituency, apart from three exceptions, should be 5% larger or smaller in terms of constituents than the norm.\"</p><p>Harper accepts that making size pre-eminent ahead of geography and community will mean constituencies, for the first time, cross county and local council borders, and possibly split wards. \"It is a trade-off. The thing we have said is that seats have to be more equal in size, so that votes are more equal in weight.\"</p><p>The review will be based on an electoral register prepared at the end of this year and completed by October 2013, giving political parties until May 2015 to select their candidates.</p><p>Labour says there is a lost army of voters – as many as 3.5 million unregistered, mainly poor voters. Harper questions that. \"Best estimates suggest 92% of the electorate are registered to vote, and it is not true all these missing voters are in Labour seats.\"</p><p>He is looking at a bigger reform to clean up politics, including shifting from household to individual registration. \"At present the head of the household registers all the other people in the household, but there is no means to check whether the people exist.\"</p><p>There have been allegations of voter fraud, but few prosecutions. Northern Ireland introduced the reform in 2006, since the country was perceived to have a bigger problem with fraud. The register fell sharply, and Harper said he was keen to ensure that people entitled to be on the register do not fall off.</p><p>Individual registration, like so much on Harper's desk, is no small reform. His predecessor, Michael Wills, said a year ago: \"If we get this wrong and large numbers of people fall off the register, it would be a disaster. We can't have this botched.\" That goes for the rest of Harper's bulging briefcase, too.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/365661218|2013-10-05T20:54:29Z|1a78d93ec2bb14d213299796371f6dbb7fdf6776 -->",

    "body":"<p>Iain Duncan Smith is not short of ambition. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/nov/11/iain-duncan-smith-unveils-welfare-contract\" title=\"\">His white paper </a>declares the universal credit system to be the most significant reform since the welfare state was created in 1947 by the towering Liberal thinker William Beveridge. What Duncan Smith offers appears to be the holy grail of social policy: simplifying the labyrinthine benefits system so that it guarantees welfare payments to a certain level of earnings, and then sees anyone who gets into work lose their entitlements at a fixed rate.</p><p>The minister is not wrong to say that a key route out of poverty is getting people back to work – many on benefits are doing an entirely rational thing by not taking jobs and thereby seeing their state handouts vanish precipitously. At present the poor face &quot;penal tax rates&quot;, losing sometimes 90% of any earned income. Duncan Smith wants to get that down to 65%.</p><p>The question is whether universal credit is a win-win policy for everyone – or as Duncan Smith puts it, &quot;there will be no losers&quot;. In fact his own white paper shows the rich losing out and the poor gaining to the tune of a few pounds a week. But given that the policy only begins in October 2013 for new claimants, it will come on the heels of housing benefit cuts which suck &pound;12 a week next year from almost a million of Britain's poorest people. Singletons suffer as well – losing the right to earn &pound;5 an hour without being taxed, a two-decade old policy meant to cover transport costs.</p><p>Women also find themselves apparently hit. The white paper makes it clear only one of the partners would receive the welfare payments. This means the child care component of the tax credit and the child element of the tax credit could end up in the pocket of the main earner, which many pressure groups say will be the man in a relationship. This would be a huge U-turn in policy – and the money is not trivial, with &pound;100 a week at stake for bigger claims.</p><p>The new sanctions will also hurt and raise the possibility that the unemployed could lose their benefits for up to three years if they refuse work. Many who know the benefits system say this is unworkable. Those who suffer sanctions, they say, are often the least equipped to deal with the loss of income.</p><p>Duncan Smith says he will apply sanctions even to those with children. Anyone with a child over one will be expected to turn up regularly to a jobcentre – with the penalty that benefits will be cut if they don't. At present the system applies the full range of sanctions only to those with children over seven. The new proposals will reduce that to five. Juggling a complex life of childcare and penury is something that requires understanding, not a loss of cash from the state.</p><p>But there is good news. The amount of income that can be earned before benefits are withdrawn is set at a &quot;cushion&quot; of &pound;110 a week for a couple with children. However bigger families will have to make do with the same amount – reinforcing the message that large poor families are a luxury that the state cannot subsidise.</p><p>There is now little doubt that benefits are being cut. Over the next few years &pound;18bn is being lost from the Department for Work and Pensions budget – and only &pound;2bn is set aside for the universal credit. This is the politics the government says the country can afford – rendering universal credit an expensive policy done cheaply.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/368609203|2013-10-05T20:54:58Z|f8beafef85085e542d4e556f1c898d5dc5bc3390 -->",

    "headline":"Preacher Duncan Smith aims for holy grail of welfare policy",
    "body":"<p>Iain Duncan Smith's reforms to the welfare system carry more than a whiff of the preacher about them, with the cabinet minister telling Radio 4's Today programme that the current system, which trapped people in worklessness, was a \"sin\".</p><p>From a man with a Christian conscience, these are strong words indeed: sins have to be repaid first in this world and then again in the next. The road to perdition will never have been so crowded with Labour ministers atoning for past transgressions.</p><p>Little surprise, perhaps, that before the unemployed are saved from their indolence, they are treated to a dose of evangelical rhetoric around the much trailed universal credit. What Duncan Smith offers appears to be the holy grail of social policy: simplifying the labyrinthine benefits system so that it guarantees welfare payments to a certain level of earnings, and then sees anyone who gets into work lose their welfare entitlements at a fixed rate.</p><p>Duncan Smith is not wrong to say that a key route out of poverty is getting people back to work – many on benefits are doing an entirely rational thing by not taking jobs and thereby seeing their state handouts vanish precipitously. At present, the poor face \"penal tax rates\", losing sometimes 90% of any earned income. Duncan Smith wants to get that down to 65%.</p><p>But before the gain there appear to be years of pain. First, the atmosphere has changed: today's headlines about cracking down on those who refuse work appeal to a political constituency that sees those at the bottom of the pile as victims not of circumstance but of their own actions. In certain newspapers the unemployed have become \"layabouts\" and \"malingerers\".</p><p>Words may not hurt as much as the tough love Duncan Smith wants to administer. First, there are the new sanctions – raising the possibility that the unemployed could lose their benefits for up to three years if they refuse work. These will apply before the universal credit starts in October 2013. Many who know the benefits system say this is unworkable. Those who suffer sanctions, they say, are often the least equipped to deal with the loss of income.</p><p>Duncan Smith says he will apply sanctions even to those with children. Anyone with a child over one will be expected to turn up regularly to a jobcentre – with the penalty that benefits will be cut if you don't. At present, the system applies the full range of sanctions only to those with children over seven. The new proposals will reduce that to five. Juggling a complex life of childcare and penury is something that requires understanding, not a loss of cash from the state.</p><p>The second unseen effect is that, under the coalition's reforms, 1.4 million of the poorest people in Britain have been lifted into a marginal tax bracket that sees them lose more than 70% of any income they might earn. While Duncan Smith trumpets his reforms' intent to lower this in a few years' time, the working poor face higher rates of tax imposed via the chancellor's budget.</p><p>Lastly, there is now little doubt that benefits are being cut. Over the next few years, £18bn is being lost from the budget of the Department for Work and Pensions – and only £2bn is set aside for the universal credit. This is the politics the coalition government says the country can afford.</p><p>The universal credit is an expensive policy done cheap. You hand less to poor people and therefore have less to take away, making the universal credit affordable. This also makes poverty a work incentive, mimicking workfare in the United States, where benefit levels are so low that many people don't apply.</p><p>Duncan Smith also echoed arguments sold by Republicans that it was nonsense to claim that there are no jobs around, when immigrants rush to take up employment. The Tory welfare secretary said that 70% of all jobs created were taken by foreigners – a claim clearly rebutted by thinktanks.</p><p>The message over the weekend was that the long-term unemployed could be forced to carry out manual work to retain their benefits. This again is an American import: work requirements have long been used to force people off benefits. But the evidence from the US is mixed: during a recession, when jobs are scarce, the country has witnessed rising numbers on food stamps and in receipt of unemployment benefit.</p><p>Is the universal credit not really a weapon of mass destitution? Duncan Smith says not. More than 2 million will be materially better off, he says. But these are likely only to emerge in the next half of the decade, given that the universal credit starts taking on new claimants three years from now. Maybe a political sin cannot be redeemed in this parliament, but only in the next one.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/368587871|2013-10-05T20:54:58Z|b45fd3d852ff0c6efef3186de157d439c22a5a0d -->",

My colleague Patrick Wintour has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/nov/11/cameron-no-turning-back-tuition-fees-rise\">the full story. </a>Cameron said the government would not change its stance on tuition fees.</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><strong>8.34am:</strong> Nick Clegg has told the BBC this morning <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11732787\">that he \"should have been more careful\" before the election about signing the NUS pledge to vote against an increase in tuition fees.</a> I think that's the closest he's come to admitting it was a mistake.</p><!-- Block 4 --><p><strong>8.36am:</strong> Here are the main points from the interviews that Iain Duncan Smith has been giving this morning about the welfare reform white paper. I've taken the quotes from the Press Association and <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com/uk/article/17644/duncan_smith_reforms_will_revolutionise_the_way_people_see_work.html\">PoliticsHome </a>(paywall).</p><p><strong>• He said his main aim was to ensure that people always knew they would be better off in work.</strong></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>We right now have a system that traps people, because it is complex, there are so many benefits withdrawn at different rates. People going back to work don't fully understand whether they are better off or worse, it is almost impossible to make that calculation. By simplifying and having one withdrawal rate we will actually make sure people will retain more of what they earn as they go back to work, thus making work pay more than being on benefits. That's the critical bit. </p></blockquote><p><strong>• He said it would take four years or more to introduce his reforms.</strong> \"People will, I hope, recognise that we don't want to rush into this, we want to do this properly,\" he said.</p><p><strong>• He described the plans as the biggest change to welfare \"arguably since Bevan\".</strong></p><p><strong>• He suggested that jobs would be available for the unemployed. </strong></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>We're coming out of a recession. More jobs are being created.... In the last three months in the job centre over a million jobs went through the job centres and every week about 450,000 jobs are advertised in the job centres ... The key point is as the growth comes in the economy, as jobs are available all we're simply saying is 'you have a responsibility now that we're making work pay, now that we're going to help you, to actually take the work that's available'.</p></blockquote><p><strong>• He said that he expected only a very small number of claimants to lose benefits under the sanctions being proposed (see 8.22am).</strong> \"We don't expect hardly anybody to be under those conditions, because people, when they recognise this will happen, I think will focus very seriously on taking work,\" he said.</p><p><strong>• He said the archbishop of Canterbury was wrong to suggest that claimants would be punished.</strong> \"Sanctions apply to those who won't cooperate when work is available, but no one's going to be punished,\" Duncan Smith said. \"This is my point to the archbishop and others - this is not about punishing people for trying.\"</p><p><strong>• He said he would not penalise disabled people who cannot work.</strong> \"Those who are disabled and not expected to work will face no penalties at all,\" he said.</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><strong>8.55am:</strong> The welfare reform white paper launch has just started. Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, is speaking. He has just described the proposals as \"the most radical overhaul of our welfare system since its inception\".</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><strong>9.02am:</strong> Nick Clegg has finished his speech now. He ended with a lavish tribute to Iain Duncan Smith. \"He deserves enormous credit for the policy we are putting forward today,\" Clegg said. Duncan Smith has \"unrivalled expertise\" in this area. Duncan Smith returned the compliment as he began his own speech. He said that Clegg's support had been very valuable. In other words, he seemed to be saying that Clegg was an ally in Duncan Smith's battles against the Treasury (who initially resisted Duncan Smith's plans).</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><strong>9.09am:</strong> Duncan Smith says that he will outline the \"specifics\" of the white paper to parliament later. But now he is just going to talk about the broad principles, he says. (The Tories used to complain vigorously about Labour ministers making announcements outside parliament. Duncan Smith is leaving himself vulnerable to the same charge.)</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><strong>9.12am:</strong> Duncan Smith has just produced some powerful figures about his plans.</p><p><strong>• 2.5m households will have higher benefit entitlements under the new universal credit.</strong></p><p><strong>• 350,000 children will be lifted out of poverty under this plan.</strong></p><p><strong>• 500,000 adults will be lifted out of poverty.</strong></p><p><strong>• The number of workless households will fall by 300,000. </strong>That was \"a conservative estimate\", Duncan Smith said.</p><p><strong>• 700,000 low earners will receive more under the universal credit.</strong></p><!-- Block 9 --><p><strong>9.21am:</strong> Duncan Smith is taking questions now, but I'm in Westminster, not Camden, and Sky and BBC News have dropped their live coverage. As soon as I get more, I'll post again. The white paper itself won't be available until Iain Duncan Smith delivers his statement in the Commons. That should be at about 12.20pm, after the business statement, although Nick Herbert, the police minister, is also due to make a statement about yesterday's student demonstration which may hold up the welfare statement, depending on which comes first.</p><!-- Block 10 --><p><strong>9.32am:</strong> Douglas Alexander, the shadow work and pensions secretary, has offered qualified support for the plans in the welfare reform white paper.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>If the Conservative government gets this change right, then we in the Labour party will support them, because there's common ground. If we can have a simpler benefits system that removes disincentives for people to get into work, we will support them. That was a big part of the work we were trying to take forward ourselves when we were in government.</p></blockquote><p>But Alexander also pointed out that, if the reforms went wrong, \"you could end up with a higher welfare bill not a lower welfare bill\". That's because in-work benefits will become more generous than they are now, to ensure that people have an incentive to work. Duncan Smith made this clear with the figures he produced at his Camden launch. See 9.12am.</p><!-- Block 11 --><p><strong>9.38am:</strong> I've already mentioned Nick Clegg apparently conceding that it was a mistake to sign the NUS pledge about not voting for an increase in tuition fees. (See 8.34am.) The Press Association has now filed the full quotes. Here they are:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I should have been more careful perhaps in signing that pledge. At the time I really thought we could do it. I just didn't know, of course, before we came into government, quite what the state of the finances were.  </p></blockquote><p>Clegg also seemed to accuse some of his Lib Dem colleagues of having their heads in the sand in relation to tuiton fees. </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I guess the easiest thing for me would have been for me to say I've signed this pledge, I'm going to put my head in the sand, I'm not going to come up with a fair sustainable solution to universities and simply refuse to deal with it. I don't think that would have been the right thing. I wouldn't have been able to live, now that I'm in government, with the idea that because, yes, I had a policy before we went into government that I now realise we simply can't implement in practice, that I wasn't going to try and put something in place that will really help generations of particularly poor, bright kids who don't presently go to university. </p></blockquote><p>That seemed to be aimed at Lib Dem MPs like Tim Farron and Sir Menzies Campbell who have said that, because they signed the pledge, there is no question of them changing their mind. Farron is quoted <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/nov/10/student-fees-protest-ministers\">at the end of today's Guardian story.</a> Campbell set out his views at length<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/nov/05/sir-menzies-campbell-interview-lib-dems-disagree\"> in a recent interview with me.</a></p><!-- Block 12 --><p><strong>9.55am:</strong> David Cameron has had plenty to say in Seoul today. As my colleague Patrick Wintour has been reporting, he has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/nov/11/welfare-iain-duncan-smith\">praised the government's welfare reforms,</a> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/nov/11/cameron-no-turning-back-tuition-fees-rise\">insisted that yesterday's demonstration will not change policy on tuition fees,</a> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/nov/11/g20-david-cameron-east-west-trade\">urged the world to tackle east-west trade imbalances</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/nov/11/david-cameron-revive-britain-2018-world-cup-bid\">tried to revive England's bid for the 2018 World Cup.</a></p><p>But he's also found time to take a swipe at George Bush. He was asked about the claim in Bush's memoirs that waterboarding saved Britain from terrorist attack. In his reply, he suggested that that wasn't true.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Look, I think torture is wrong and I think we ought to be very clear about that. And I think we should also be clear that if actually you're getting information from torture, it's very likely to be unreliable information.</p></blockquote><p>Cameron also suggested that Bush's decision to open Guantanamo Bay was counter-productive.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I think there is both a moral reason for being opposed to torture - and Britain doesn't sanction torture - but secondly I think there's also an effectiveness thing about what he said. Thirdly, I would say if you look at the effect of Guantanamo Bay and other things like that, long-term that has actually helped to radicalise people and make our country and our world less safe, so I don't agree.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 13 --><p><strong>10.29am:</strong> The full text of Iain Duncan Smith's speech about the white paper is <a href=\"http://www.dwp.gov.uk/newsroom/ministers-speeches/2010/11-11-10.shtml\">on the Department for Work and Pensions' website</a> now.</p><p>I haven't seen the full text of Nick Clegg's speech to the same event, but <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com/uk/article/17649/clegg_beveridge%E2%80%99s_dream_has_been_distorted.html\">PoliticsHome </a>(paywall) have put up extracts. The most interesting passage was the one where Clegg claimed that William Beveridge would have approved of today's white paper. Clegg said that Beveridge would have been unhappy with the benefits system as it operates now because he did not want it to encourage welfare dependency.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>That is what today's announcements are about. Returning welfare in this country back to its original purpose. Nearly 70 years ago, its architect, the great Liberal William Beveridge imagined a system that gave people protection from cradle to grave but not one that would act as a crutch every day in between. Yes the state should offer security in hard times. But it should not, as Beveridge himself warned, stifle, incentive, opportunity, responsibility... Beveridge's dream has, however, been distorted.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 14 --><p><strong>11.11am:</strong> The Unite union has accused Iain Duncan Smith of trying to resurrect the Victorian distinction between the \"deserving poor\" and the \"undeserving poor\". This is from Gail Cartmail, Unite's assistant general secretary.</p><blockquote><p>The atmosphere being created is of a division between the 'deserving' and 'undeserving' poor. We deny that such division exists. The income inequality in the UK is wider than most other OECD countries – those developed countries with whom the UK can most easily compare. This is because of low pay and gender discrimination, especially against part-time women workers. Government policy is pushing people into joblessness – the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) latest forecast is 1.6m. The sums do not add up - divide unemployed into vacancies and there remains a lack of jobs already. Looking into the future the predicted joblessness is on a level not seen since the dole queues of the last Tory era of the 1980s.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 15 --><p><strong>11.29am:</strong> For the record, here are the latest <a href=\"http://today.yougov.co.uk/politics/govt-trackers-update-10th-nov\">YouGov GB polling figures</a>.</p><p>Conservatives: 42% (up five points from general election)<br />Labour: 37% (up seven)<br />Lib Dems: 11% (down 13)</p><p>Government approval: -5</p><!-- Block 16 --><p><strong>11.49am:</strong> You can read all today's Guardian politics stories <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/all\">here</a>.

The only question is whether it should then be for the people of Oldham East and Saddleworth to have the final say, by allowing Woolas to contest the re-run election. I think that the three-year disqualification is wrong, and that he should be allowed a final appeal to the court of his constituents.</p></blockquote><p>• <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article2803184.ece\">The Times</a> (paywall) says that computer problems could hold up Iain Duncan Smith's plans to introduce a universal credit.</p><blockquote><p>A new universal credit, merged from over 100 benefits, is due to be phased in from October 2013 with pilots running from March that year. However, the business plan for Revenue and Customs says the update to its PAYE system, essential for the new credit, will not be completed until April 2014.</p><p>The Times has now been told that ministers are already making contingency plans in case the system is not working in time. HMRC is planning to revamp its tax IT system so that income can be assessed weekly or monthly, rather than in arrears annually. This allows the Department for Work and Pensions to assess fluctuations in income — essential for the implementation of universal credit. A spokesman for the HMRC admitted yesterday that the new software was far from finalised and the Government still had to consult employers and payroll managers about the best design. The contract has not gone out to tender and the department has no estimates of the cost of the system. </p></blockquote><p>• <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/benedict-brogan/8124553/Will-we-remember-David-Cameron-for-the-triumphs-or-the-trivia.html\">Benedict Brogan in the Daily Telegraph</a> says that Tory MPs are showing signs of discontent.</p><blockquote><p>The frequency of Tory rebellions is running at a post-war record. Members of the 1922 Committee executive, who act as the shop stewards for the parliamentary party, predict that the mid-term bruising endured by Barack Obama will come early for Mr Cameron, probably this time next year. \"It's not the Tea Party he's got to worry about,\" goes the gag doing the rounds. \"It's the tea room.\"</p></blockquote><p>• <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/still-in-the-duck-house-life-after-the-expenses-row-2130788.html\">Oliver Wright and Kevin Rawlinson in the Independent</a> find out what has happened to various MPs who stood down or were defeated at the election after controversy about their expenses.</p><!-- Block 17 --><p><strong>12.08pm:</strong> Iain Duncan Smith will be unveiling his welfare reform white paper in the Commons shortly. He has already delivered one speech on the subject this morning, but he made a point of saying that he would not be revealing the details until he spoke in the Commons. MPs get very shirty if they think government announcements are not being made on the floor of the House of Commons. We already know the broad outlines of what Duncan Smith is proposing. But we should learn a bit more, and we'll get a chance to read the white paper for the first time. We'll also get to find out how MPs react. Labour's Douglas Alexander has said that he supports the principle of what the government is trying to achieve, but some of his colleagues will probably be more critical.</p><!-- Block 18 --><figure data-media-id='gu-image-368599867'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2010/11/11/1289478005559/Screengrab-from-BBC-News--006.jpg' alt='Screengrab from BBC News of Iain Duncan Smith announcing his welfare reforms in the Commons' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Screengrab from BBC News of Iain Duncan Smith announcing his welfare reforms in the Commons Photograph: BBC News screengrab</figcaption></figure><p><strong>12.17pm:</strong> Iain Duncan Smith is speaking now.</p><!-- Block 19 --><p><strong>12.23pm:</strong> He says he has consulted as widely as possible about his plans, which are designed to ensure that people are better off in work. </p><p>He says there are 5 million people of working age on out-of-work benefit and almost 2 million children growing up in workless households.</p><!-- Block 20 --><p><strong>12.25pm:</strong> Some have said that the priority should be jobs, he admits. But unemployment is a long-standing problem. Millions of people are detached from the labour market. These reforms are designed to bring them back in to the labour market.</p><p>By reducing the complexity of the system, he will reduce the opportunities for fraud and error, which currently cost the taxpayer £5bn a year.</p><p>Under the current system, people who get a job can end up losing more than £9 for every £10 they earn. Duncan Smith says that, under his reforms, the maximum marginal deduction rate (the amount someone loses in tax and benefits when they find work) will fall from 95.8% to 76.2%. Under the universal credit, the \"taper\" rate will be 65% (meaning that someone will get to keep at least 35p for every £1 they earn).</p><p>Duncan Smith repeats the figures he set out this morning about his proposals lifting 500,000 adults and 350,000 children out of poverty. (See 9.12am.)</p><!-- Block 21 --><p><strong>12.33pm:</strong> Douglas Alexander is responding for Labour now. He says both parties want a simplified benefits system. If the government gets its reforms right, Labour will support them. He says pensions reform was the subject of cross-party agreement in the last parliament. He hopes the same will apply to welfare reform now.</p><p>Alexander says Duncan Smith originally proposed a taper rate of 55%. (He is referring to the <a href=\"http://www.dwp.gov.uk/consultations/2010/21st-century-welfare/\">green paper published by Duncan Smith in July</a>.) Today's proposals are less generous, Alexander says. He suggests that the Treasury is to blame.</p><p>Alexander asks if Duncan Smith's figures about the impact of his plans on poverty (see 9.12am) take into account the impact of the government's welfare cuts.</p><p>Can Duncan Smith promise that he won't have to raid his budget for extra money if the costs of setting up the universal credit turn out to be higher than expected?</p><p>Alexander says Duncan Smith's claim to want to give people an incentive to find work are incompatible with his plans to cut housing benefit for the unemployed.</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><strong>12.39pm:</strong> Duncan Smith is disappointed by Alexander's response. He says he expected him to be more positive about the plans.</p><p>The £2.1bn that has been set aside to set up this system during this spending review will be enough, he says. More money will be necessary in the next spending review period, because implementation will run into the next parliament. But money will be available for that too.</p><p>Duncan Smith says he is determined that the IT will be well managed. (He is making this point in response to today's Times story - see 11.49am.)</p><p>On the subject of the taper rate, Duncan Smith says everyone who goes back to work will be better off. If Labour wants a 55% rate, that's fine. But Labour will have to explain where the money would come from. Labour has not given an answer to that.</p><!-- Block 23 --><p><strong>12.44pm:</strong> Roger Gale, a Conservative, suggests that the plan amounts to the introduction of \"workfare\". That's welcome, he says. </p><p>Anne Begg, the Labour chairman of the work and pensions committee, says creating a single benefit is the \"holy grail\" of welfare reform. She says she will support the plans if they work. </p><p>Peter Lilley, a Conservative former social security secretary, asks how he will deal with the problem that people might be reluctant to get a job because they fear losing housing benefit.</p><p>Duncan Smith says claimants will only have to make one application. It will be a \"seamless process\". This should ensure that people do not worry about losing benefit in the way Lilley suggested.</p><!-- Block 24 --><p><strong>12.44pm:</strong> Duncan Smith says his reforms will particularly benefit women, because so many of them are in part-time work.</p><!-- Block 25 --><p><strong>12.46pm:</strong> Jenny Willott, a Lib Dem MP, asks who will run the work programme.</p><p>Duncan Smith says the work programme will start next summer. There will be contracts involving the private sector and the voluntary sector. They will be paid by results.</p><p>Labour's Malcolm Wicks, a former welfare minister, welcomes what Duncan Smith is trying to achieve but asks if there will be enough jobs in the private sector.</p><p>Duncan Smith says more than 1m jobs have been available in job centres over the last three months.</p><!-- Block 26 --><p><strong>12.47pm:</strong> Disability living allowance won't be included in the universal credit, Duncan Smith says, because it's not an out-of-work benefit.</p><!-- Block 27 --><p><strong>12.47pm:</strong> Labour's Glenda Jackson asks for a guarantee that these changes will not be used by employers to drive down wage levels.</p><p>Duncan Smith says he hopes that Labour will not just \"hope for the worst\". Jackson should be glad about the prospect of the poorest 30% becoming richer, he says.</p><!-- Block 28 --><p><strong>12.54pm:</strong> The SNP's Eilidh Whiteford says that she applauds what Duncan Smith is trying to do, but that she is still struggling to see where all the jobs will come from.</p><p>Duncan Smith says the universal credit will be implemented over a long period. The economy is growing, he says.</p><!-- Block 29 --><p><strong>12.54pm:</strong> Philip Hollobone, a Conservative, asks how travel costs are taken into account in the universal credit. He says the cost of travelling can often make the difference between a job being worthwhile or not. Duncan Smith accepts this. He says more money will be available to pay people's travel costs because they will get to keep more of the money they earn.</p><!-- Block 30 --><p><strong>12.58pm:</strong> Andrew George, a Liberal Democrat, asks if the plan to make the unemployed work will be a \"stick\" or a \"carrot\".</p><p>Duncan Smith says reports of this have been exaggerated. It will be an option available to advisers in job centres. For some people, it will help them get ready for work, because they will learn the discipline of doing a job. In other cases, where advisers suspect that someone is doing a job that they are not declaring, it will be used as a sanction. If they have to go on a work programme, they will not be able to claim benefit while doing a black market job at the same time.</p><!-- Block 31 --><p><strong>1.02pm:</strong> Labour's Chuka Umunna asks about the Times story about computer problems holding up the implementation of universal credit. (See 11.49am.) Duncan Smith says the Department for Work and Pensions will not need to use the full capacity of HM Revenue and Customs' new system. It will only need to use a part of it, he says. He implies that the delay mentioned in the Times is not a problem.</p><!-- Block 32 --><p><strong>1.04pm:</strong> Labour's Helen Goodman says that the unemployed should not have to take the first job available. There is no point having physics graduates working at a supermaket checkout, she says.</p><p>Duncan Smith says he is \"disappointed\" by her comment. The important thing is to get people into work, he says. At this point someone heckles him, suggesting that he does not have any experience of this. Duncan Smith angrily replies that he has been unemployed. At the time, he would have given anything to get a job, he says.</p><!-- Block 33 --><p><strong>1.08pm:</strong> Duncan Smith insists that no one will lose out from his reforms.</p><!-- Block 34 --><p><strong>1.08pm:</strong> Peter Bone, a Conservative, says the government needs to change the culture of worklessness. Duncan Smith says the work programme will achieve this.</p><!-- Block 35 --><p><strong>1.08pm:</strong> Duncan Smith says that, listening to Labour, he cannot tell whether they are converted, or whether they \"hate the idea that someone is doing something that they should have done 10 years ago\".</p><!-- Block 36 --><p><strong>1.10pm:</strong> Bob Russell, a Liberal Democrat, says children were mentioned only twice in Duncan Smith's statement. He asks if the sanctions will affect families with children.</p><p>Duncan Smith says his plans should lift 350,000 children out of poverty.</p><!-- Block 37 --><p><strong>1.13pm:</strong> Labour's Cathy Jameison asks Duncan Smith if he supports the living wage.</p><p>Duncan Smith says his plan is the best way to ensure that households end up with a living wage.</p><!-- Block 38 --><p><strong>1.14pm:</strong> Labour's David Winnick says that in the \"real world\" 18 people are chasing every vacancy. Some of Duncan Smith's comments are reminiscent of Norman Tebbit's claim that the unemployed should \"get on their bikes\".</p><p>Duncan Smith says Winnick should welcome the statement.</p><!-- Block 39 --><p><strong>1.16pm:</strong> Labour's Fiona Mactaggart says that in Slough the average bus fare is £3.50. A woman who gets a part-time job could find much of her extra money eaten up by her bus fare. Will Duncan Smith help people pay their travel costs?</p><p>Duncan Smith says that if people have more money, they will have more money to pay their travel costs.</p><!-- Block 40 --><p><strong>1.33pm:</strong> What sort of response did Beveridge get when he unveiled his great plan for the welfare state? Does anyone know? Iain Duncan Smith was clearly expecting a much better reception than he got, and by the end of his statement he was sounding distinctly tetchy. </p><p>Anne Begg (who chairs the select committee that deals with this issue) was spot on when she described a single, unified benefit of the kind proposed by Duncan Smith as the \"holy grail\" of welfare reform. (See 12.44pm.) Duncan Smith seemed to think he deserved a hero's welcome. </p><p>Most Labour MPs said they supported what he was trying to do in principle, but it did not take them long to start hurling objections, raising from the churlish to the utterly reasonable (of which the most important was - will there be enough jobs?) This is certainly policy making at its boldest. Whether it turns out to be a success or not is, at this stage, frankly anyone's guess. I have not seen the white paper yet, but it should be on the <a href=\"http://www.dwp.gov.uk/newsroom/press-releases/\">department's website soon</a>.</p><!-- Block 41 --><figure data-media-id='gu-image-368599866'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/04/09/recap2.gif' alt='Live blog: recap' width='40' height='40' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>2.12pm:</strong> Here, a little later than usual, is a <a name=\"A\">lunchtime summary</a>.</p><p>• <strong>Iain Duncan Smith said that 500,000 adults and 350,000 children would be lifted out of poverty under this plans to reform the welfare statement</strong>. The work and pensions secretary released the figures as he published <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/nov/11/iain-duncan-smith-unveils-welfare-contract\">a long-awaited white paper on welfare reform</a>. Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, described the proposals as \"the most radical overhaul of our welfare system since its inception\". Labour's Douglas Alexander said that the opposition would support the proposals in principle, but - to Duncan Smith's apparent disappointment - most Labour MPs who spoke in the Commons were sceptical about whether the government's plans would actually achieve what they were supposed to.</p><p>• <strong>Alan Johnson, the shadow chancellor, has said that the economy was too reliant on the City when Labour was in power</strong>. <a href=\"http://www2.labour.org.uk/the-real-debate-about-our-economic-future---johnson\">In a speech</a>, he said Britain's tax base was \"less resilient\" than it should have been before the banking crisis struck because the Exchequer was so reliant on tax revenue from the financial services industry, and also tax revenue related to rising house prices. Johnson said Labour would try to amend the legislation setting up the Office for Budget Responsibility so that the OBR has to make a regular assessment of the resilience of the tax base. He used used the speech to challenge at length claims that Labour let spending get out of control in the last parliament.</p><p>• <strong>Nick Clegg has said that he should have been \"more careful\" about signing the NUS pledge promising to vote against an increase in tuition fees</strong>. In an interview on ITV's Daybreak, he said: \"I should have been more careful perhaps in signing that pledge. At the time I really thought we could do it.\" He also suggested that his Lib Dem colleagues who are refusing to back the government's plans have their heads in the sand. In his speech, Alan Johnson said the Lib Dem U-turn over tuition fees was \"probably the most cynical political betrayal I have ever witnessed\".</p><p>• <strong>Nick Herbert, a Home Office minister, has criticised the way the police handled yesterday's demonstration against tuition fees</strong>. In a statement to MPs, Herbert said: \"The police have to strike a balance between dealing promptly and robustly with violence and unlawful activity on the one hand, and allowing the right to protest on the other. Clearly, in this case, the balance was wrong. But these are difficult decisions and they are not taken lightly.\" Sir Paul Stephenson, the Metropolitan police commissioner, said today that some officers \"came perilously close to being seriously injured\" during the protests.</p><p>• <strong>The Conservative party has suspended <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/nov/11/twitter-stoning-conservative-mp\">a councillor who posted a comment on Twitter</a> suggesting that the columnist Yasmin Alibhai-Brown should be stoned to death</strong>. \"Language of this sort is not acceptable and as a result Gareth Compton's membership of the Conservative party has been indefinitely suspended pending further review,\" a party spokesperson said.</p><p>• <strong>David Cameron has cast doubt on George Bush's claim that waterboarding prevented a terrorist attack against Britain</strong>. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/nov/11/david-cameron-challenges-george-bush-waterboarding\">In an interview in Seoul</a>, the prime minister said: \"I think torture is wrong and I think we ought to be very clear about that. And I think we should also be clear that if actually you're getting information from torture, it's very likely to be unreliable information.\"</p><p>• <strong>Cameron also said world leaders must resolve trade imbalances</strong>. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/nov/11/g20-david-cameron-east-west-trade\">Speaking at the start of the G20 summit</a>, he said: \"The biggest issue of all is the cause of the last crisis – a wall of money in the east, a wall of debt in the west. We've got to deal with that imbalance and I think it's a real test for this summit and one that Britain will play a very positive part in trying to make sure we really look at these imbalances and deal with them.\"</p><!-- Block 42 --><p><strong>3.07pm:</strong> The Tory councillor who posted a comment on Twitter about Yasmin Alibhai-Brown being stoned to death (see 2.12pm) has now been arrested.

My colleague Martin Kettle points out that when Beveridge published his report, people queued all night to get hold of a copy and the first print run sold out immediately. Iain Duncan Smith's document – which runs to 68 pages and is called Universal Credit: Welfare that Works – is unlikely to do so well. If you do want to buy a copy, it'll cost you £19.75, I see. But you can <a href=\"http://www.dwp.gov.uk/policy/welfare-reform/legislation-and-key-documents/universal-credit/\">download it for free here</a>.</p><p>But another reader emailed me to say that there may be some similarities between Beveridge and Duncan Smith.</p><blockquote><figure data-media-id='gu-image-368599865'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/04/08/email.gif' alt='Live blog: email' width='40' height='40' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The Beveridge report was received with great approval among the public according to the Ministry of Information but the parliamentary reaction was perhaps not dissimilar. It was decided that, as it was published in 1942, it was welcomed in principle, but that, given the war and the unclear future, the plan should not be put into practice until the financial situation was clearer after the war ... But the Tories and the Liberals quickly adopted the report's proposals, while Labour were sceptical about Beveridge's idea of a National Health Service (envisaged as run through local health centres and regional hospital administrations) because they preferred a state-run body instead ... Nevertheless, Labour started implementing the report after the war and Beveridge was elevated to the Lords as a Liberal peer.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 44 --><p><strong>3.21pm:</strong> Phil Woolas's judicial review against the election court decision removing him from parliament will start on Tuesday next week, the BBC and Sky are reporting.</p><!-- Block 45 --><p><strong>3.30pm:</strong> Plenty of reaction to the welfare white paper is now coming in. Here's a selection of comment from welfare charities. Generally, they seem to be very sceptical.</p><p>From Kate Wareing, Oxfam's director of UK Poverty:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Changes to the benefits system proposed today will expose people to the risk of destitution. Removing benefits and leaving people with no income will result in extreme hardship for them and their families. This sanction, and the proposals to force people to do unpaid work are based on stigma. Most people receiving benefits do want to work, and punishing them as if they are criminals repaying a debt to society is not a fair way to treat someone entitled to support.</p></blockquote><p>From Richard Hawkes, chief executive of disability charity Scope:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Despite a progressive vision, this white paper does not address the state of the employment market today, nor take into consideration the reality of people's lives. And worryingly, it plans to introduce a \"regime of sanctions for those that don't play by the rules\". What about those disabled people who do play by the government's rules? Who try repeatedly to get work but are not successful?</p></blockquote><p>From Fiona Weir, chief executive of the single parent charity Gingerbread:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Gingerbread welcomes government moves to make work pay and to simplify the benefits system but warns that without more jobs that fit with school hours, and help with childcare costs, thousands of single parents will stay trapped on benefits.  Gingerbread is also very concerned that single parents could face the threat of sanctions. Most single parents want to work but find the odds heavily stacked against them and the effect of financial sanctions would plunge children into unacceptable levels of poverty.</p></blockquote><p>From Helen Dent, chief executive of Family Action:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The existing sanctions regime creates sufficient incentives to actively seek work, and to take job opportunities when they are offered.  Further toughening of sanctions for jobseekers would be unnecessarily punitive, and would not tackle the key issues of job availability, and the provision of holistic support which many of our service users need to make employment sustainable.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 46 --><p><strong>3.33pm:</strong> Here's the statement that the Labour press office has issued from Douglas Alexander, the shadow work and pensions secretary. In interviews this morning Alexander sounded broadly supportive (see 9.32am). He has not contradicted himself, but his tone is now definitely more negative.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p><br />We support the underlying principle of simplifying the benefits system and providing real incentives to work.</p><p>My concern is that George Osborne's recent actions reveal he doesn't support these principles - he has already both complicated the system and undermined incentives to work through changes such as the reduction in working tax credit.</p><p>Some of the key aspects of Iain Duncan Smith's original plan already seem to have been cut and that could mean some people facing bigger barriers to getting back to work.</p><p>And our overriding concern is that there is a fatal flaw at the heart of these proposals - without work they won't work.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 47 --><p><strong>3.43pm:</strong> Here's an afternoon reading list.</p><p>• Paul Goodman <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2010/11/six-months-of-david-cameron-as-prime-minister.html\">at ConservativeHome</a> on David Cameron.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Cameron is a born leader, who reminds me, as he may other readers of a certain age, of \"Grabber\" in the Molesworth books, who was \"Head of Skool, Captain of Everything, and winner of the Mrs Joyful Prize for Rafia Work\".  He listens, thinks, makes decisions - generally in that order - cracks jokes, writes nice notes to staff, and above all doesn't panic.  Like Macmillan again, who was fond of quoting the lines from Gilbert and Sullivan, he believes that \"quiet, calm deliberation disentangles every knot\".  Tony Blair would have milked the Commons Bloody Sunday statement, announced a new gun crackdown after the Cumbria shootings, and been photographed in full-dress uniform chairing COBRA after the Yemen bomb plot.  That Cameron did none of these things, but simply got on with the business of government in each case, made me want to stand on a chair and cheer.  This undemonstrativeness shouldn't be mistaken for weakness. John Major once said: \"When your back's to the wall, it's time to turn round and fight\".  Cameron wouldn't say exactly the same (as a former colleague pointed out, why pick on the wall?), but he doesn't crack when pushed into a corner, as he proved with the noteless speech at the 2007 Conference which played a part in staving off a snap election.</p></blockquote><p><br />• Alex Barker <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/westminster/2010/11/there-are-losers-from-ids-universal-credit/\">at the FT's Westminster blog</a> says there are losers from Iain Duncan Smith's welfare reforms. They are people in the top four deciles, meaning they are relatively well-off.</p><p>• Tom Watson <a href=\"http://www.tom-watson.co.uk/ministerial-art/\">on his blog</a> on what works of art ministers are hanging on their office walls.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p><br />Chancellor George Osborne shows that he likes it big and bold – he has opted for a 6 foot wide oil by the famous nonsense poet Edward Lear. Lear's painting, 'View of Beirut', presents a romantic image many years before the area was torn apart in a civil war. In addition, on Osborne's wall hangs a 7ft long engraved map by Grayson Perry. It depicts a divided country, at war with itself, with the instructional title of 'Print for a Politician'. It begs the question whether he bought it to learn cartography, or did the message of diversity just appeal. £68,727 worth of artwork lines the Chancellor's walls in total – based on the values given for when the artwork was acquired.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 48 --><p><strong>3.59pm:</strong> Here's an afternoon summary.</p><p><strong>• Welfare groups have responded with scepticism to Iain Duncan Smith's plans for welfare reform.</strong> Despite claims that the proposals will lift nearly 1m adults and children out of poverty, charities have complained that the sanctions are too punitive and that Duncan Smith seems to be placing too much reliance on the creation of jobs that may not materialise. Brendan Barber, the TUC general secretary, has criticised the plans. \"Some people will undoubtedly make small gains, but it is poor and vulnerable people, as well as working families on middle incomes, who will pay for most of those gains through the government's £18 billion programme of welfare cuts,\" he said. Labour also seems to be adopting a more critical tone. (See 3.30pm and 3.33pm.)</p><p><strong>• The Tory councillor who sent a Twitter message saying that the newspaper columnist Yasmin Alibhai-Brown should be stoned to death has been arrested. </strong>(See 3.07pm.)</p><p><strong>• Simon Hughes, the Lib Dem deputy leader, has attacked Labour MPs for their decision to support Phil Woolas. </strong>\"Labour's leaders had spoken but since then many Labour MPs have come out in support of Phil Woolas both on and off the record,\" Hughes said <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/latest_news_detail.aspx?title=Simon_Hughes%3a_Who_is_speaking_for_Labour%3f_&amp;pPK=1ef4901e-99ad-427e-915b-4954430e03c7\">in a statement.</a> \"The judgement of the court was clear: Phil Woolas made statements which were not about Liberal Democrat politics but personal attacks on our candidate's character and conduct which he had no reasonable grounds for believing were true and did not believe were true. Residents in Oldham East and Saddleworth and across the country will not understand why the Labour Party won't say clearly, with one voice, that there is no place in British politics for this kind of behaviour.\" Hughes made his statement as it emerged that Woolas's judicial review of the election court decision will begin next Tuesday.</p><p><strong>• It has emerged that the government would be able to transfer some minor powers to the EU without a referendum under the government's EU bill.</strong> The bill, which has been published today, is designed to ensure that there has to be a referendum if the government wants to transfer any powers to Brussels. But, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11736570\">as the BBC reports,</a> the legislation shows this so-called \"referendum lock\" will not apply if proposed treaty changes are not \"significant\".</p><p><strong>• William Hague, the foreign secretary, has named the members of his new advisory group on human rights.</strong> As he says <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=48706682\">in a statement,</a> they will meet twice a year and they will not be paid.</p><p>That's it for today.

    "body":"<p>All stay at home mothers claiming the government's new universal credit will be required to make themselves available for work or lose state support, putting them on a par with single parents for the first time. The requirement would apply to mothers with children aged over seven.</p><p>The proposals came in the government's welfare bill published on Thursday and were hailed by David Cameron as \"tough, radical ... but fair\".</p><p>His remarks came as ministers published a raft of figures alongside the bill, for the first time showing the full impact of the introduction of universal credit and other welfare cutbacks announced by ministers. The figures show 1.7m households will lose out from the universal credit reforms.</p><p>Nearly 75% of these will suffer reductions of less than £25 per week, but 100,000 households will lose more than £75 a week. The biggest losers, the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) said, are likely to be single people without children, those working more than 30 hours, those not in receipt of housing benefit, and households with savings of more than £16,000.</p><p>Ministers have insisted there will be no losers, but this only holds true at the point of transition onto the new scheme due to a special fund set up to temporarily compensate those whose benefits are due to be cut. A total of 100,000 claimants – those in the poorest 40% – are expected to gain by at least £4,000 a year. A further 1m households will see an increase in income of at least £25 a week. Improved entitlements and take-up should mean 300,000 children are taken out of poverty.</p><p>The new universal credit, largely constructed by the work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith while in opposition, is a single benefit for working-age adults. It unifies the current myriad system of means-tested out-of-work benefits, tax credits and support for housing. All three parties have backed the principle of the reforms, but the shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne expressed misgivings about the lack of funding and the difficulty of introducing the change at a time of high unemployment.</p><p>Cameron claimed that perverse incentives and complexities within the existing system had \"insidiously drained hope away from swathes of our society\", and actively encouraged people to behave in ways which were irresponsible. The universal credit will be introduced at a net annual cost of £2.6bn from October 2013 with all claimants on the scheme by 2017.</p><p>The DWP assessment, published alongside the bill, also suggests the government intends to save £2bn from cutting back on fraud and administrative error.</p><p>In cases of suspected fraud, ministers will introduce a new minimum penalty of £350, or 50% of the amount overpaid, whichever is greater, up to a maximum of £2,000.</p><p>To encourage personal responsibility a new civil penalty of £50 will be payable for anyone negligent in maintaining their benefit claim. Cautions will no longer be part of the DWP sanctions policy.</p><p>But the system will see increased take-up costing an extra £2bn annually and another £2.7bn because of higher extra entitlements. These figures exclude other savings to the welfare budget. The details also suggest ministers have still to resolve some key issues including how credit is to be paid and whether to include child tax credit and council tax benefit. It has been decided to exclude carers allowance.</p><p>Plans to cut housing benefit by 10% for those unemployed for more than a year have been dropped. The DWP also estimates that a cap on housing benefit for workless households will see 50,000 households have their benefits reduced, losing on average around £93 per week and leading to evictions.</p><p>Before the introduction of universal credit, the sanctions regime will be tightened.</p><p>In a disturbing assessment, the Association of Learning Providers (ALP), the body that represents work providers, also warned that the plans to pay work providers by results \"is fraught with risks which may impact significantly on the number of unemployed people who can benefit from it\".</p><p>The ALP warns the funding for the scheme is too tight, alongside very high performance expectation that equate to the highest levels ever achieved under the Labour government's New Deal, a work programme delivered at a time of much lower unemployment.</p><p>Graham Hoyle, the ALP chief executive, warned the whole programme's operation is in danger.</p><p>The Social Market Foundation, a thinktank, criticsed the attack on savers estimating that there are around 400,000 families with children who have savings above £16,000 currently receive tax credits.</p><p>New claimants will be denied payments if their savings exceed the £16,000 limit.</p><p>Ian Mulheirn, Director of the SMF said the rules will \"send all the wrong signals\" to families on benefits about the need to save and be prudent.</p><p>Cameron said the decision to dump the proposal for a 10% housing benefit cut after 12 months showed that the government was listening.</p><p>He said: \"This was a proposal made before the statement and development of the universal credit.\"</p><p>However other cuts in housing benefit support remain. Cameron described the reforms as \"tough, radical... but fair\".</p><p>Cameron said: \"I know this country and therefore refuse to believe that there are 5 million people who are inherently lazy and have no interest in bettering themselves and their families. \"Making low-income working families thousands of pounds worse off through welfare cuts over the next two years to claim that they will be slightly better off in 2013 is an absurd argument that will ring hollow as families suffer the toughest income squeeze for nearly a century.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/371856905|2013-10-05T20:55:28Z|cc85ccb420f05e714e3fd0b1ffa96c16a8002418 -->",

    "body":"<!-- Block 1 --><p><strong></strong></p><!-- Block 2 --><p><time>8.35am:</time> <strong>David Cameron</strong> and<strong> Iain Duncan Smith</strong> are publishing the welfare bill today. It is routinely described as the biggest reform of the welfare state for 60 years and at its core is a plan to replace existing out-of-work benefits with a single universal benefit, which will be designed in such a way as to make it always worthwhile for people to work. This is seen as the &quot;holy grail&quot; of welfare reform - a wonderful idea, if it can be made to work.</p><p>Duncan Smith has been giving interviews about the bill this morning. On the Today programme, he confirmed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/feb/17/nick-clegg-housing-benefit-cut-dropped\">Patrick Wintour's report in the Guardian today</a> saying the government has dropped plans to impose a 10% cut on housing benefit on anyone unemployed for more than a year. </p><p>But he did dispute the suggestion that it was Nick Clegg who killed the idea. Duncan Smith said the idea was flawed because, under the government's plans, people who have been unemployed for more than a year will get intensive help through the work programme anyway. That means they won't need an extra sanction to encourage them to get a job, he said.</p><p>Cameron will deliver a speech on welfare speech at about 11.15am. Downing Street released some extracts overnight, and they show that Cameron believes that the welfare state needs to be reformed because people are less responsible than they were 60 years ago.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>When the welfare system was born, there was what we might call a collective culture of responsibility. More than today, people's self-image was not just about their personal status or success…it was measured out by what sort of citizen they were; whether they did the decent thing. That meant that a standardised system of sickness and out-of-work benefits – with limited conditions – was effective.</p><p>It reached the people who needed that support, and not those who didn't, in part because fiddling the system would have brought not just public outcry but private shame. In other words, personal responsibility acted as a brake on abuse of the system.</p><p>And because the ethos of self-betterment was more wide-spread, the system supported aspiration rather than discouraging it. Now let's be honest about where we've travelled to, from there to here. That collective culture of responsibility – taken for granted sixty years ago – has in many ways been lost.</p></blockquote><p>Otherwise, it's a fairly quiet day. But I'll be covering all the breaking political news - such as it is - as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web. I'll post a lunchtime summary at around 1pm, and an afternoon one at about 4pm.</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><time>8.51am:</time><a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com\"> PoliticsHome </a> and the Press Association have been monitoring the interviews Iain Duncan Smith has been giving this morning about the welfare bill. Here are the main points.</p><p><strong>• He claimed that nobody would be worse off under his plans.</strong></p><blockquote><p>Nobody will be worse off because every single person, as we migrate them on to this new credit, will be cash-protected. That means that whatever system you are on, we will stay at that level whilst the new system is set.</p></blockquote><p><strong><br />• He claimed that almost 1m people would be lifted out of poverty under this plans.</strong></p><blockquote><p>The key thing about the system is that by bringing [benefits] together, simplifying them and making sure that people understand it, and by changing the way they're withdrawn so there's a simplified system – actually what we're going to see is just under 1m people will be lifted out of poverty because of this, and 1m people, mostly of the poorest, will see increases of around &pound;25 per week as they go back to work.</p></blockquote><p><strong>• He said that foreign nationals took more than half of the 2m jobs created under Labour. </strong>But 4m people were on benefits, he said. &quot;That doesn't make any sense to me,&quot; he said.</p><p><strong>• He confirmed that he is dropping plans to cut housing benefit by 10% for anyone unemployed for more than a year.</strong></p><blockquote><p>We won't see this in the bill for one very good reason. The more we looked at this, the more I reviewed the interplay between that reduction at 12 months and the universal credit and work programme meant that all of these people were going to move into the work programme anyway, so they would be having intensive help to get back to work.</p></blockquote><p><strong>• He dismissed the idea that Nick Clegg was responsible for this decision.</strong></p><blockquote><p>I made it clear when I was in front of the select committee that I was prepared and I looking at that interplay and what I want to do is to make sure there are no disincentives for the unemployed. I am fully one with Nick and others on this. It's a very good idea.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 4 --><p><time>9.04am:</time> Ed Miliband has issued a statement about the government's decision to drop its plan to sell state-owned forests.</p><blockquote><p>The sorry saga of the forest sell-off demonstrates how incompetent and out of touch this Government is. Virtually every person in the country could see selling off our forests was a foolish and short-sighted policy but they went ahead regardless. Now they are panicked into a retreat hours after Mr Cameron said they would carry on with their consultation. This is a chaotic and incompetent way to run government.</p><p>But the very idea of the forest sell-off shows something else. This government doesn't seem to understand the things we value which we hold in common. Just as people are angry about the threat to the forests, so too the threat to local libraries, children's centres, other common institutions. The decisions they are making suggest a government which understands the price of everything and the value of nothing.</p></blockquote><p>Later, when I get a chance, I'll post a list of all the U-turns we've had so far from the government. Do mention some in the comments if you think there are any I'll forget.</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><time>9.35am:</time> For the record, here are <a href=\"http://today.yougov.co.uk/politics/govt-trackers-update-16th-feb\">the latest YouGov GB polling figures.</a></p><p>Labour: 45% (up 15 points since the general election)<br />Conservatives: 35% (down 2)<br />Lib Dems: 10% (down 14)</p><p>Labour lead: 10 points</p><p>Government approval: -26</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><time>9.52am:</time> Reform, a centre-right thinktank, has today published <a href=\"http://www.reform.co.uk/Research/ResearchArticles/tabid/82/smid/378/ArticleID/1429/reftab/161/t/2011%20Reform%20scorecard/Default.aspx\">a report on the government's public service reform programme.</a> It is not impressed. The policies are &quot;all over the place&quot;, it says.</p><blockquote><p>In most cases the departments are failing the prime minister's reform challenge. The health reforms do not make the NHS accountable to patients. Even the schools reforms deliver neither open choice for parents nor true autonomy for schools. What should be more worrying for the prime minister is the inconsistency between and even within departments. Some departments want an open competition in public service markets while others want to favour mutuals or social enterprises or small firms. Some departments are arguing that resources do not equal results while others have guaranteed spending increases. The Department for Education wants more academies that are free from the national curriculum yet wants to impose a national curriculum on the vast majority of schools. The Department for Work and Pensions will means-test child benefit but not any other universal benefit.</p><p>These contradictions are a gift to the opponents of reform, who can argue, for example, that private sector delivery in healthcare must be a mistake if the government forbids it in education. But they also make the task of implementation much harder. The government wants new investment into new public service organisations but the uncertainty and inconsistency will damage investors' confidence. </p></blockquote><p>The <a href=\"http://www.reform.co.uk/portals/0/Documents/2011%20Reform%20Scorecard%20FOR%20DISTRIBUTION.pdf\">report itself </a>(pdf) also includes a scorecard supposedly showing which departments are doing best at reform. The Home Office comes top; it gets a B for its police reforms. The Cabinet Office comes bottom, with an E. <a href=\"http://order-order.com/2011/02/17/a-wonky-circle/\">As Guido Fawkes has pointed out, </a>by a happy coincidence Nick Herbert, the minister in charge of the Home Office police reforms used to run Reform before he became an MP in 2005.</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><time>10.17am:</time> Caroline Spelman, the environment secretary, is going to make a statement in the Commons on the decision to abandon the forest privatisation at about 12.30pm. The term &quot;humiliating U-turn&quot; is a journalistic clich&eacute;. But, for once, the adjective humiliating really does seem appropriate. It is hard to think of any major departmental policy that has sunk so quickly.</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><time>10.34am:</time> There's going to an urgent question in the Commons about Bahrain too. Here's the running order.</p><p>Now - Business Department questions - now<br />11.30am - Urgent question on Bahrain.<br />Around 12pm - Business questions <br />Around 12.45pm - Caroline Spelman's statement about the forest privatisation U-turn.</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><time>10.47am:</time> You can read all today's Guardian politics stories here. And all the politics stories filed yesterday, including some in today's paper, are here.</p><p>As for the rest of the papers, here are the articles I found particularly interesting.</p><p>• Andrew Grice<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/no-10-attempts-to-bring-errant-ministers-to-heel-2217237.html\"> in the Independent</a> says David Cameron is going to recruit 10 new policy advisers to improve the way Number 10 operates.</p><blockquote><p><br />Nine months into his premiership, Mr Cameron has decided to fine-tune the Downing Street machine. With hindsight, his aides admit, he has allowed ministers too much leeway to draw up and announce policies without No 10 knowing the full details ...</p><p>The policy unit was a powerful force under Labour but was scaled back by Mr Cameron, partly because he had pledged to employ fewer special advisers. He scrapped the Downing Street delivery unit set up by Labour, with some staff leaving and others transferred to the Cabinet Office.</p><p>The number of special advisers, publicly funded officials who carry out party-political tasks, was cut from 78 under Gordon Brown to 68. It was hoped this would reduce the &pound;6.8m wage bill by &pound;2m. But the changes could result in the Cameron regime employing more special advisers than Labour did. Insiders say the promise to have fewer did not anticipate the extra pressures of a coalition. Junior and middle-ranking Liberal Democrat ministers may be allowed to recruit special advisers for the first time.</p></blockquote><p>• Benedict Brogan <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/benedictbrogan/100076545/shocking-news-%E2%80%93-there-might-be-some-proper-tories-in-no-10/\">in the Daily Telegraph</a> says that, contrary to some assumptions, there may be a proper Tory in Downing Street.</p><blockquote><p>Steve Hilton, so often teased for his Californian manners and his hippy look, is arguably the most ideologically Conservative member of the inner circle. Recently, his role has been enhanced by the Prime Minister. He is being put in charge of a beefed-up policy unit, and is more than ever the driver of what Mr Cameron knows might well prove to be a one-term project.</p><p>Mr Hilton would be the first to acknowledge that if the public does not understand what the Government is doing, it is the Government's fault, not the public's. But look beyond the presentational problems, and it is possible to argue that our contempt for the Big Society idea is no different from the opprobrium heaped on Mrs Thatcher in the early months of 1980, eight months after she took office and years before the significance of her economic reforms became clear.</p><p>&quot;We have to be better at explaining that what we are doing is deeply Conservative. It is about a smaller state. But it is much too early to expect people to understand that this is a social revolution,&quot; one aide says. In myriad ways, the Coalition is dismantling the &quot;Big Government&quot; that is Mr Cameron's opposite of the Big Society ... Behind the noise about the Big Society, the shrinking of the state is well and truly underway.</p></blockquote><p>• Daniel Martin <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1357760/Lord-Falconer-leads-revolt-judges-Coalition-targets-diamond-encrusted-pensions.htm\">in the Daily Mail </a>says Lord Falconer is leading a fight in the Lords to stop judges having to contribute more to the cost of their pensions.</p><blockquote><p>The Pensions Bill, which is going through the House of Lords, will give the Ministry of Justice the power to force judges to contribute and to decide how much more they should pay.</p><p>Welfare reform minister Lord Freud said: 'It is right that judges, like other public service pension scheme members, should begin to contribute towards their own pensions&quot; ...</p><p>And in a debate on Tuesday night, Lord Falconer argued that to increase pension contributions would effectively be a pay cut.</p><p>'The constitutional points here are very significant,' he said. 'This is an obvious deterioration in their terms and conditions.'</p><p>He said the Pensions Bill would give ministers 'a classic tool with which to interfere with judicial independence'.</p></blockquote><p>• Greg Hurst <a href=\" http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/education/article2916673.ece\">in the Times</a> (paywall) says the National Union of Students has described the government's tuition fee reforms as &quot;relatively progressive&quot; in a private memo.</p><blockquote><p>The NUS has publicly opposed any rise in tuition fees but the briefing note appears to contradict that stance, calling the Government's higher education reforms &quot;progressive&quot;. It also admits that funding cuts are not as drastic as the union has claimed ...</p><p>Aimed particularly at universities in the Russell Group and the 1994 Group of smaller research universities, it cautions NUS officers against trying to stop universities setting the maximum fee. It says that &quot;simply campaigning for a low fee might not generate the results you require (especially inside the Russell and 1994 Group)&quot;.</p><p>On the reforms of student finance, with a high repayment threshold and payments spread over 30 years, the note says that &quot;the vastly increased numbers of graduates that will never pay the loan off are in fact what makes the system relatively progressive&quot;.</p><p>It contradicts Aaron Porter, the president of the NUS, who previously criticised the rise in fees.</p></blockquote><p>• <a href=\" http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article2916539.ece\">The Times</a> says some prominent Labour supporters of the alternative vote will refuse to campaign for it.</p><blockquote><p>[Harriet] Harman said: &quot;I will be voting for AV, but I won't be doing any campaigning for it because my priority is to help elect Labour councillors. We will be campaigning against Lib Dem candidates, not working with the Lib Dems on AV.&quot; </p></blockquote><p>• James Kirkup <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/elderhealth/8329548/Thousands-more-will-have-to-sell-homes-for-elderly-care.html\">in the Telegraph</a> says the government is freezing for at least two years the threshold for savings above which elderly people have to pay for their own care. This means thousands more people will have to pay, he says.</p><blockquote><p><br />Around 250,000 people aged over 65 are estimated to be funded by councils in residential care homes, and the figure is forecast to grow steadily in the coming decades. Charges are based on a means test, under which anyone with savings and assets, including a house, worth more than &pound;23,250 must pay the full fees ...</p><p>Normally, the threshold increases each year to take account of inflation and rising values of assets such as houses. Ten years ago, it was &pound;18,500.</p><p>But the Coalition has quietly decided to freeze the limit for at least two years. The move is likely to amount to a real-terms cut in the threshold of almost 10 per cent. A lower capital limit of &pound;14,250 – above which councils pay part of the fees – has also been frozen. The decision was disclosed in a Department of Health document. </p></blockquote><p>• <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article2916707.ece\">The Times</a> (paywall) says some families could face paying an extra &pound;400 because councils are increasing the fees they charge for services.</p><blockquote><p><br />A survey by The Times of the country's key councils reveals that many propose to increase charges by up to 400 per cent to avoid further cuts in frontline services. Parking, rubbish collection and burials are among those worst affected.</p><p>Some authorities have opted to charge for the first time in areas such as home care, libraries, pest control, after-school clubs and child-minding. In the past, town halls have raised extra income through an increase in council tax. But this year the Chancellor has imposed an effective freeze, forcing council chiefs to look at other areas.</p><p>A 4 per cent increase in council tax this year would have cost the average household an extra &pound;57, but the new fees have added hundreds of pounds to bills. The scale of the rises in some councils is prompting local protests and the threat of judicial reviews. </p></blockquote><!-- Block 10 --><p><time>11.13am:</time> David Cameron will be making his welfare speech shortly. The Department for Work and Pensions has published its bill this morning. The details are available here, <a href=\"http://www.dwp.gov.uk/policy/welfare-reform/legislation-and-key-documents/welfare-reform-bill-2011/index.shtml\">on the DWP website.<br /></a><br />Rather unusually, LabourList is running an article on the reforms today headlined:<a href=\"http://www.labourlist.org/in-praise-of-iain-duncan-smith\"> In Praise of Iain Duncan Smith.</a></p><!-- Block 11 --><p><time>11.28am:</time> The Cameron/Duncan Smith event is about to start.</p><!-- Block 12 --><p><time>11.30am:</time> David Cameron and Iain Duncan Smith are at <a href=\"http://www.toynbeehall.org.uk/page.asp?section=00010001000100010002\">Toynbee Hall in London. </a>Duncan Smith says Toynbee Hall has always been associated with people who want to improve society.</p><!-- Block 13 --><p><time>11.32am:</time> David Cameron is speaking now. He says he started this week with a speech about the Big Society. Perhaps he should have come to Toynbee Hall, he says. It's an &quot;exemplar&quot; of the Big Society. He admires the way it combines doing with thinking and teaching.</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><time>11.33am:</time> Cameron says Iain Duncan Smith has made the Conservative party think about poverty. For too long people have thought about the consequences of poverty, but not the causes, he says. Duncan Smith has made people focus on the causes. If politics is about changing lives, Duncan Smith already has a legacy, Cameron tells the audience.</p><!-- Block 15 --><p><time>11.35am:</time> Cameron is now talking about the bill. He says that it is about making work pay.</p><p>Some elements of the bill have been &quot;amended and rationalised&quot;, he says. (That's a new euphemism for a U-turn - he talking about<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/feb/17/nick-clegg-housing-benefit-cut-dropped\"> the housing benefit proposals.)</a></p><p>The bill will encourage responsibility, he says.</p><p>One in four adults are out of work, he says. That has to change.</p><p>Creating a working welfare system is not just an economic necessity; it's an ethical necessity too. </p><p>Other politicians have promised to get to grips to welfare before. Cameron says he will explain why this time the government will make a real difference.</p><!-- Block 16 --><p><time>11.40am:</time> Cameron makes the point about people being more responsible 60 years ago. I quoted this extract earlier. (See 8.35am.)</p><p>He says the welfare system now operates in such a way as to encourage people to be irresponsible.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>But I know this country and therefore refuse to believe that there are five million people who are inherently lazy and have no interest in bettering themselves and their families. <br /> <br />What I want to argue is that the real fault lies with the system itself. The benefit system has created a benefit culture. It doesn't just allow people to act irresponsibly, but often actively encourages them to do so. Sometimes they deliberately follow the signals that are sent out. Other times, they hazily follow them, trapped in a fog of dependency. But either way, whether it's the sheer complexity and the perverse incentives of the benefits <br />system, whether it's the failure to penalise those who choose to live off the hard work of others, or whether it's the failure to offer the right support for people who are desperate to go back into work, we've created the bizarre situation where time and again the rational thing for people to do is, quite clearly, the wrong thing to do. </p></blockquote><!-- Block 17 --><p><time>11.44am:</time> Cameron is now giving examples of how the system encourages people to be irresponsible.</p><p>High marginal deduction rates mean that a single mum has no incentive to work if she is going to lose 96p for every &pound;1 she earns, he says.</p><p>And the benefits system makes it sensible for couples to live apart.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p><br />You might think, no one would split up because of benefits. But in our country today, there are two million people who 'live apart together' – that is couples who maintain separate homes while being economically interdependent. Can we honestly say the signals in the benefit system have nothing do with this? </p></blockquote><!-- Block 18 --><p><time>11.46am:</time> Cameron says nothing has shocked him more since he has come into government than the situation with housing benefit.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>We inherited a system that cost &pound;20 billion a year, with some claimants living in property worth &pound;2,000 a week in rent. That's &pound;104,000 a year. That's the income taxes and national insurance contributions of sixteen working people on median income ...</p><p>We've been sending a signal to people that if they're out of work, or on a low wage, and <br />living in an expensive home in the centre of a city, that the decision to go back to work, or take a better paid job, could mean having to move to a cheaper home, in a different part of the city, in order to escape benefit dependency. </p></blockquote><!-- Block 19 --><p><time>11.49am:</time> Cameron is now talking about how the universal benefit will be. He says it will be much simpler than the current system.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>With the universal credit, you would keep 35p of benefit for every extra pound you take home. And because this rate of benefit withdrawal is the same whatever you earn - it's easy to calculate just how much better off you will be. </p></blockquote><!-- Block 20 --><p><time>11.51am:</time> Cameron is now talking about the tougher sanctions that will be imposed.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>So if you're unemployed and refuse to take either a reasonable job or to do some work in your community in return for your unemployment benefit, you will lose your benefits for three months. Do it again, you'll lose it for 6 months. Refuse a third time and you'll lose your unemployment benefits for three years. </p></blockquote><!-- Block 21 --><p><time>11.52am:</time> People who can't work and can't be expected to work will be supported, Cameron says. &quot;Full Stop, end of story.&quot;</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><time>11.53am:</time> Cameron says the government will pay companies to get the unemployed into work.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Don't let anyone tell you this happened before. Under the last government's model, some companies still got a large share of their payment – even if they didn't get someone into work. We're saying: we will withhold the vast majority of these companies' payments until they get someone into work – and they stay in work.</p></blockquote><p>He says that people have been suggesting programmes like this for years. But in the past the Treasury opposed them. Now the Treasury is in favour. Cameron pays tribute to Lord Freud, the welfare minister, for helping to develop this idea. He says he is glad the Tories &quot;poached&quot; Freud from Labour.</p><!-- Block 23 --><p><time>11.57am:</time> Cameron says the bill marks the beginning of &quot;a cultural change&quot;. It will create &quot;a new culture of responsibility&quot;, he says.</p><!-- Block 24 --><p><time>12.02pm:</time> Nick Robinson from the BBC asks about the housing benefit U-turn and forests.</p><p>David Cameron says the housing benefit plan was announced before the government finalised details of its work programme. The government should listen to experts, he says.</p><p>On forestry, he says Caroline Spelman will be making a statement in the Commons. The government wants to open up forests, and to make this area of policy &quot;cost effective&quot;. </p><p>Again, if you launch a consultation and you get a &quot;very strong response&quot;, it is right to take notice, he says.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Should we listen to people along the way? Yes. I thought that was the point of a listening government.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 25 --><p><time>12.04pm:</time> Someone from Mencap asks about the withdrawal of the mobility component from disability living allowance for people in care homes.</p><p>Cameron says, as someone who has filed in the DLA forms, he knows how complicated they are.</p><p>On the mobility component, the government wants to avoid an &quot;overlap&quot;, with people being funded twice.</p><p>Iain Duncan Smith says the government has listened. No one in a care home will lose the money they need for mobility, he says. The department will take longer than expected to work out the details.</p><!-- Block 26 --><p><time>12.07pm:</time> An ITN reporter asks Cameron if he agrees with Iain Duncan Smith that some Britons are too lazy to work.</p><p>Cameron says that he listened to Duncan Smith's interview on the Today programme (see 8.51am) and that this is not what Duncan Smith was saying. Cameron says he does sometimes listen to the Today programme, although it can disturb his wellbeing. It is best to listen in short doses, he suggests. </p><p>Cameron says the government has to do more to ensure that people get into work. </p><p>Many parts of the bill will be &quot;hard fought&quot; in parliament, he says. There are many areas where the government will have to look again.</p><p>Cameron is still going strong, but BBC News and Sky have now had enough.</p><!-- Block 27 --><p><time>12.16pm:</time> Here's that final quote from Cameron in full. It's interesting, because Cameron seems to be acknowledging that there will be more U-turns to come on the welfare reform bill.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I expect there will be many parts of this bill that will be hard fought in both Houses of Parliament, and lots of difficult issues and many things that we will have to examine all over again. But we've got to get this done, not just to make our national finances add up, but actually to make sure that we give people the opportunity to get into work and out of poverty.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 28 --><p><time>12.24pm:</time> The government has published <a href=\"http://www.dwp.gov.uk/policy/welfare-reform/legislation-and-key-documents/welfare-reform-bill-2011/index.shtml\">18 separate impact assessments to go with the welfare reform bill. </a>These documents are highly technical, but they're worth reading because they tell you what officials actually think the costs and benefits of legislation will actually be. I've just been skimming through <a href=\"http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/universal-credit-wr2011-ia.pdf\">the universal credit impact assessment (pdf).</a> Here are the key points.</p><p><strong>• Universal credit will be introduced in October 2013 and it will take four years before everyone switches onto it.</strong></p><p><strong>• Benefit spending will be &pound;2.6bn a year higher in net terms once universal credit is full established.</strong> Benefits will be &pound;2bn more generous and increased take-up will lead to another &pound;2.6bn a year being spent. So &pound;4.6bn more a year will be spent on benefits. But the government will save &pound;2bn a year from less fraud and error.</p><p><strong>• Around 2.7m households will have qualify for more in benefit. </strong>Around 1m will see their entitlements go up by more than &pound;25 a week. Some 85% of that increase will go to the poorest 40% of homes.</p><p><strong>• Transition protection will ensure that there are no cash losers.</strong> At the point of transition, households who would otherwise lose will receive &quot;full cash protection&quot;.</p><p><strong>• Some 1.7m households will qualify for less in benefit in the long term.</strong> Some 75% will have a reduction of less than &pound;25 a week.</p><p><strong>• Some 1.46m households will see their marginal deduction rate - the amount they lose in benefits for every extra &pound;1 they earn - go down.</strong> There will be virtually no households with an MDR of more than 80%. (In other words, virtually no one will lose more than 80p for every extra &pound;1 they earn.)<br /><strong><br />• But some 2.11m households will see their marginal deduction rate go up.</strong><br /><strong><br />• The median marginal deduction rate will go up by 4 percentage points.</strong></p><!-- Block 29 --><p><time>12.38pm:</time> Caroline Spelman is making her statement on the forest sell-off U-turn now.</p><!-- Block 30 --><p><time>12.38pm:</time> Spelman starts by saying she takes full responsibility for what has happened.</p><!-- Block 31 --><p><time>12.39pm:</time> Spelman says she has three announcements to make.</p><p><strong>• The consultation on the proposed sell-off will be cancelled.</strong></p><p><strong>• The clauses relating to the Forestry Commission will be taken out of the public bodies bill.</strong></p><p>•<strong> A panel will be set up to advise on the future of forests.</strong></p><p>Spelman says that if there is one key lesson from this episode, it is that people &quot;cherish their woodlands and forests.&quot;</p><p>She apologises.<br /><strong><br />I am sorry. We got this one wrong.</strong></p><p>She thanks her colleagues for their support.</p><p><strong>• Spelman apologises for proposing to privatise state-owned forest. She says she takes full responsibility for what went wrong.</strong></p><!-- Block 32 --><p><time>12.42pm:</time> Mary Creagh, the shadow environment secretary, asks Spelman when she was told about the decision she is announcing.</p><p>Creagh says today is not a victory for politics as usual. It's a victory for those people who have campaigned for their local forests and woods. She pays tribute to the &quot;silent majority&quot; who spoke up.</p><p>Creagh asks if the sale of the 15% of Forestry Commission land that has already been postponed will now be abandoned for good.</p><p>Who will sit on the new advisory panel, she asks.</p><p>How will the Forestry Commission work more efficiently if it is losing a quarter of its staff?</p><p>Creagh congratulates Spelman on being the only secretary of state in living memory to unite the Socialist Workers Party with the National Trust in opposition to her plans.</p><!-- Block 33 --><p><time>12.48pm:</time> Spelman says she made the decision to abandon the consultation at a meeting with the consultation.</p><p>She criticises Creagh for not acknowledging that Labour left the nation's finances in a poor state.</p><p>She says the advisory panel will represent a &quot;broad range of views&quot;.</p><p>And she says it was hard to take what Creagh said about Labour's support for the countryside.

Earlier (see 10.17am) I said this was a rare moment where that old journalist clich&eacute; about a &quot;humiliating&quot; U-turn was appropriate. But, having listened to Spelman's statement, I'm not sure it was that humiliating, if humiliating means liable to lower one in the esteem of others. Spelman apologised fully and frankly. It wasn't a standard politician's apology: &quot;I regret this happened ...&quot; or &quot;I'm sorry about.&quot; This was a real, full-on mea culpa.</p><blockquote><p><br />I would first like to say that I take full responsibility for the situation that brings me before the House today ... I am sorry, we got this one wrong, but we have listened to people's concerns.</p></blockquote><p><br />It's rare to hear contrition like this in the Commons and - you know what? - it seemed to go down rather well. You would expect Tory loyalists to rally her support, as they did. But the MPs praising Spelman for her honesty included people like the Lib Dem Greg Mulholland, who is no stooge in anyone's book. Spelman wasn't particularly eloquent, and at times she did sound quite tearful (although I think that's just her voice), but she was candid and straightforward. At one point, in response to a rather over-the-top intervention from Sir Gerald Kaufman, she directly addressed the point about the affair being humiliating.</p><blockquote><p><br />It's only humiliating if you are afraid to say sorry. One of the things that we teach our children is to be honest. It's not a question of humiliation. It's my choice.</p></blockquote><p>Politicians normally hate having to perform U-turns because it makes them look shambolic and incompetent. Spelman still has these adjectives hanging around her neck. But voters also like it when politicians admit that they make mistakes (something Gordon Brown never really appreciated, to his cost) and Spelman emerged from the Commons chamber looking less damaged than I would have predicted two hours ago.</p><!-- Block 56 --><p><time>2.22pm:</time> Here, later than usual, is a &quot;lunchtime&quot; summary.</p><p><strong>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/feb/17/david-cameron-welfare-reform-bill\">David Cameron has unveiled what he describes as &quot;the most ambitious, fundamental and radical changes to the welfare system&quot; for 60 years.</a></strong> We're finally going to make work pay – especially for the poorest people in society,&quot; the prime minister said in a speech at London's Toynbee Hall. &quot;And we're going to provide much greater support for unemployed people to find work – and stay in work.&quot; The bill will replace existing out-of-work benefits with a single universal credit. In the long run it will add &pound;2.6bn a year to the welfare bill, and the government says it could lift almost 1m people out of poverty. </p><p><strong>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/feb/17/forest-sell-off-abandoned-sorry-caroline-spelman\">Caroline Spelman, the environment secretary, has apologised to the Commons for proposing to privatise state-owned forests.</a></strong> &quot;I am sorry, we got this one wrong, but we have listened to people's concerns,&quot; she told MPs. She said that the consultation on the proposed sell-off was being halted, that the forestry clauses would be taken out of the public bodies bill and that she was setting up an independent panel to advise her on forestry policy.

Fortunately, the little country is about to set another world record, one previously held by Iraq: Friday will mark its 250th day without a new national government.</p><p>Remarkably, this doesn't seem to worry Belgians too much. In the land of the surreal, protest calls primarily appeal to the smile on your face, with light-hearted &quot;protest actions&quot; such as men letting their beards grow until a government is in place, or women following Lysistrata's example and refusing sex until an agreement is made. Top of the bill is the initiative by some citizens of Ghent (renowned for their anti-establishment rebelliousness) to organise a public party in the streets of their city on Thursday night, counting down to the new world record. In an ironic trailer, people are asked to gather and &quot;help our political heroes through the last hours&quot;.</p></blockquote><p>• Alex Barker <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/westminster/2011/02/top-ten-facts-on-universal-credit/\">at the FT's Westminster blog</a> has 10 facts about universal credit.</p><p>• Paul Waugh on his<a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com/uk/article/22520/lib_dem_wins.html\"> PoliticsHome blog</a> says the Lib Dems seem to be &quot;wearing the trousers&quot; in government at the moment.</p><blockquote><p>David Cameron has just used his welfare speech to point out that there have been some things dropped from the IDS bill. He said that was simply proof that Coalition Government - with all its hammering out of policy - was working properly.</p><p>Yet having executed more U-turns than a Top Gear stunt driver special, it sometimes just looks as though the Cameroons' haste is catching up with them. Some Libs quietly point out that almost all of the U-turns are on rushed-out policies that they privately warned needed more work.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 59 --><p><time>4.07pm:</time> Here's an afternoon summary. There's only one new item to add.</p><p><strong>• David Willetts, the universities minister, has said universities should have charters setting out students' rights.</strong> &quot;Too many universities still don't have a charter,&quot; he said <a href=\"http://nds.coi.gov.uk/content/detail.aspx?NewsAreaId=2&amp;ReleaseID=418136&amp;SubjectId=2\">in a statement.</a> &quot;Improving student information is a key priority for the Government.

    "headline":"Universal credit's 2013 delivery could be derailed by complex IT system",
    "body":"<p>Ministers have been warned in a confidential report that welfare reforms designed to encourage people back to work risk being delayed because they depend on the successful launch of a complex government IT system.</p><p>Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, plans to introduce the much-vaunted universal credit – designed to make work pay for those currently on benefits – by 2013. But the success of the reform depends entirely on building a computer program to establish how much each universal credit claimant is earning in work and how much they are due from the state.</p><p>A report commissioned by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), details of which have been leaked to the <em>Observer</em>, reveals serious concerns among government IT suppliers over whether the deadlines for the new system can be met. It also says that Duncan Smith's claim that no one would be worse off working under the new system &quot;may challenge plans to transition tens of millions of accounts in a four-year window. There may be thousands of exceptional cases that inhibit... the finish date of 2017.&quot;</p><p>The government has yet to announce the identity of its IT supplier for the universal credit project, which will have a tie-up with the PAYE systems run by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC). However, in May, during a conference call organised to announce his company's quarterly results, the chief executive of Informatica, a Californian IT firm, said it would be involved.</p><p>Consultants at Intellect, the trade body for the IT industry, were commissioned by the government late last year to ask IT suppliers whether the DWP's timescales for the universal credit were realistic. In their report to Iain Duncan Smith, they wrote: &quot;While many felt that from a technology perspective the timescales appeared achievable, this came with heavy caveats. Some felt the timescales were aggressive and cause for concern, particularly since the precise requirements are unlikely to be confirmed before the final bill is approved by parliament.</p><p>&quot;Some suppliers felt the timescales were unrealistic, citing the following reasons: there are no alternatives being prototyped; eight months for the core development is possible if done properly, but unrealistic given the number of additional traditional interfaces, and in particular the one from HMRC.&quot;</p><p>When Joe Harley, chief information officer at the DWP, was asked last month by the Commons public accounts committee whether the new system would be the most complicated ever undertaken, he would not deny it.</p><p>Last night Labour MP Stephen Timms, the shadow employment minister, said: &quot;Ministers' promise to put all new benefit applicants through the new universal credit IT system by October 2013 looks unrealistic. The new IT system will require every employer in the country to send PAYE data electronically every month to HMRC,&quot; Timms said. &quot;That is a huge undertaking on its own. And key elements of universal credit policy are still not decided – for example, how self-employed people will be handled and how support for childcare will be assessed. From my experience of past government IT projects, there just isn't time now to sort it all out before the deadline.&quot;</p><p>Last night Intellect refused to comment on its report, citing confidentiality. A DWP spokesman said: &quot;Universal credit is on track and on time to secure a welfare state fit for the 21st century.&quot;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/375894619|2013-10-05T20:56:06Z|6f29d7fcc129b59346d53d45ae7d2ddc450b29d3 -->",

The Tories could lose as many as 15 seats and Labour 25.

He predicted that the junior coalition partners could lose 14 seats in the shakeup.</p><p>The boundary changes are uniquely important to the Lib Dems since so many of their MPs are dependent on the power of incumbency for their re-election.</p><p>The plan to reduce the number of seats was pushed through parliament by David Cameron as part of a bill introducing the referendum on a new voting system for the Commons, subsequently lost by the Lib Dems and the Yes campaign. Cameron would see it as a betrayal if the Lib Dems tried to block the specific plans set out by the boundary commission.</p><p>It is already known that England will see 31 seats cut from the current 533, Scotland will lose seven from 59 and Wales will lose 10 from 40.</p><p>Within England, most seats (seven) will be lost in the north west, the west midlands and London (five each).</p><p>The changes mean the seats needed for an outright majority will fall to 301 in the next parliament.</p><p>If voters replicated their 2010 behaviour at the next election, the Tories would win only 291 seats – prompting the need for a second coalition government.</p><p>Conservative sources were predicting some major personality battles ahead, such as in Liverpool where two seats are likely to be lost.</p><p>The sources predicted that Stephen Twigg, the MP who defeated Michael Portillo in Enfield Southgate in 1997, will find himself pitted against the well-regarded shadow climate change minister, Luciana Berger.</p><p>Shadow cabinet colleagues Ed Balls and Hilary Benn may also find themselves competing for a seat in Yorkshire.</p><p>In the south east, Lib Dems Mike Hancock and Norman Baker might be fighting for a single winnable seat in the Portsmouth/Lewes area.</p><p>Private discussions have been underway between parties to try to reach a common front on the boundary review, including the extent to which they breach ward or county boundaries.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/377325029|2013-10-05T20:56:20Z|68000af3ca4e14448bb138695dab2d3b2e9276d2 -->",

The Construction sector showed a small decline. </p><p>The interpretation of the estimate for Q3 is complicated by the special events in Q2 (for example, the additional bank holiday in April for the royal wedding), which are likely to have depressed activity in that quarter. As with 2010 Q4 and 2011 Q1 (affected by the bad weather in Q4) it may be wise to look at 2011 Q2 and 2011 Q3 together, rather than separately. On that basis GDP has grown by 0.6 per cent in the last two quarters and by 0.5 per cent in the last year. </p><p>Returning to the latest quarter, there is no evidence to suggest that the riots in August had any significant impact on GDP for Q3. </p></blockquote><!-- Block 10 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">9.48am:</span> And here's more from the ONS economic review.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>GDP is estimated to have grown by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2011. GDP has increased by 0.5 per cent over the latest year, a significant slowdown from the 2.6 per cent growth in the preceding twelve months. </p><p>Growth in the third quarter was led by the services sector which accounts for just over 76 per cent of total GDP. Services contributed the whole of the 0.5 per cent increase in GDP in the quarter, with a small positive contribution from the production industries being offset by a contraction in construction output. </p><p>Over the past year, GDP growth has been wholly dependent on growth in the services sector, which in total contributed 0.9 points to GDP growth over the year. Construction reduced GDP growth over the year by 0.3 percentage points, and production industries by another 0.1 points.

The International Labour Office warned yesterday that the world economy was on the verge of a new and deeper jobs recession. In the latest three months (to August), employment in the UK was 178,000 lower than in the previous three months.

For years, Greek voters have been saddled with choices between the third-rate products of self-proclaimed political dynasties: the Papandreous, the Venizelos, the Karamanlis. As is usually the rule (thank goodness Westminster doesn't really do dynasties, Hilary Benn aside) none of them is as good as their fathers or grandfathers was. Politicians are now so despised by the people that Greek MPs cannot show their faces in Athenian tavernas for fear of being mobbed.</p><p>The political class has failed even to persuade the Greeks of the need for spending cuts and tax rises, let alone convince them they have got the detail right. And don't let anyone tell you the cuts aren't real, that austerity isn't being implemented in Athens. It has been dictated by the EU and the IMF. The yacht owners will find a way round all the tax rises of course, as they always do. But the ordinary Greek is hurting. As in Britain, the pumped-up public sector is beginning to shed jobs. A big rise in VAT has sent the cost of living spiralling, and is beginning to hit tourism. Pensioners are threatened with 20 per cent overnight cuts in their retirement payments. A new property tax, meanwhile, will hit five million families.</p><p>Increasingly, the Greek newspapers are filled with anti-German rhetoric. Posters of favoured Army generals are beginning to be seen in Athens, and a coup is not completely out of the question (it's only 35 years since the end of the military junta).</p></blockquote><p><br /><a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com/uk/article/38581/does_anyone_believe_in_eu_deal.html\">• Mark Gettleson at Political Pulse says a poll of City figures revealed a &quot;profound level of scepticism&quot; about the chances of the European bailout plan succeeding.</a></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Taken as a whole, however, the city slammed the agreement, with just 24% expressing even a modicum a confidence in it and 65% seeing themselves as sceptical, including 18% 'completely sceptical'. As fielding took place in the 48 hours following the deal, long before the Greek referendum wheeze was announced, none of this bodes well.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 27 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">3.00pm:</span> Here's an afternoon summary.

    "body":"<p>Leading addiction charities have expressed deep concerns over government plans to cut the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/benefits\" title=\"\">benefits</a> of people suspected of suffering from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/alcohol\" title=\"\">alcoholism</a> or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/drugs\" title=\"\">drug</a> addiction who refuse treatment for their condition.</p><p>In a sign of the government's new benefits regime – which lies at the heart of <a href=\"www.guardian.co.uk/politics/iain-duncan-smith\" title=\"\">Iain Duncan Smith</a>'s cost-cutting <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/welfare\" title=\"\">welfare</a> changes – staff in Jobcentre Plus offices will be encouraged to cut the jobseeker's allowance of claimants who reject treatment for addiction.</p><p>The new rules will come into place in October 2013, when the universal credit, which is designed to wrap benefits into one payment, is introduced.</p><p>A new claimant contract lies at the heart of the universal credit reforms. Claimants will have to sign a contract in which they agree to look for work in exchange for an undertaking from the government to support them while they do so.</p><p>Government sources said the contract would allow Jobcentre Plus staff to say that suspected addicts were in breach of their commitments if they refused help for alcoholism or drug addiction.</p><p>However, some of those involved in helping people addicted to drugs and alcohol warn that removing benefits could jeopardise their recovery.</p><p>Niamh Eastwood, the chief executive of the charity Release, said: \"Iain Duncan Smith's proposal is tantamount to coercive treatment. The previous government attempted to introduce mandatory treatment through their welfare reforms of 2009. The clause was dropped in the final hours before the legislation was approved because of concerns over legality.</p><p>\"There are similar concerns around what is being proposed by the secretary of state for the Department for Work and Pensions today. In no other area of health would we see such an approach being taken, but again and again successive governments seek to stigmatise further those with addiction who are often vulnerable and marginalised individuals and fail to recognise the complex nature of this condition.\"</p><p>Eastwood said she was concerned that at no time during the parliamentary passage of the welfare reform bill was it proposed that the claimant contract would include a \"treatment or sanctions requirement\". Without proper scrutiny of the proposal this should not go through, she said.</p><p>Martin Barnes, the chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.drugscope.org.uk/aboutus\" title=\"\">DrugScope</a>, has written to the work and pensions secretary asking him to clarify the plans.</p><p>\"We are surprised and concerned at reports that ministers believe that stopping benefits is an appropriate or effective way of engaging people with drug or alcohol treatment and supporting their recovery,\" he said. \"If accurate, this would be a reversal of the government's publicly stated position.\"</p><p>Barnes said there was no evidence to suggest that \"using the stick of benefit sanctions\" would help people engage with treatment and aid recovery.</p><p>He added: \"Indeed, the risk is that people will disengage from support services, potentially worsening their dependency and the impacts on their families and communities. Linking benefit to a requirement to undergo treatment would set a dangerous precedent for people with physical or mental health problems and would be against the principles for healthcare set out in the NHS Constitution.\"</p><p>Barnes said that while DrugScope welcomed the government's commitment to supporting people in treatment and recovery, \"much more needs to be done to make this a reality\".</p><p>Simon Antrobus, the chief executive of <a href=\"www.addaction.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Addaction</a> – one of the UK's largest specialist drug and alcohol treatment charities – said people could not be forced into abstinence.</p><p>\"Encouraging people with serious drug and alcohol problems to access support is always the best option,\" he said.</p><p>\"Those that Addaction help on a daily basis will tell you how coming off drugs or alcohol is extremely difficult, and how deciding to access treatment took them a very long time. Remove financial stability during that time, and you can severely damage someone's chances of beating an addiction and recovering.\"</p><p>Antrobus said family-focused, properly funded and integrated community treatments would prove far more effective, adding: \"The jobcentre could prove to be an excellent referral to that kind of support, without resorting to measures that could only add to a person's problems.\"</p><p>That view was echoed by Eric Appleby, the chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.alcoholconcern.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Alcohol Concern</a>.</p><p>\"Incentives are only part of the story; the real answer is to make sure that high quality treatment services are fully funded and available all over the country,\" he said.</p><p>\"At the moment only one in 16 people with an alcohol problem are receiving specialist alcohol treatment. In order to make this work, jobcentre staff will need to be properly trained in order to recognise when someone has an alcohol problem and to be able to offer the right advice.\"</p><p>Sir Ian Gilmore, the Royal College of Physicians special adviser on alcohol, said: \"Current treatment facilities for addicts in this country, particularly those with alcohol dependence, are woefully inadequate and we strongly support initiatives to improve this.  However, patients must be treated with respect and given genuine choice in their treatment options, and these must be fully respected in any scheme.\"</p><p>Duncan Smith will give a sense of the new rules when he addresses an event in parliament organised by <a href=\"http://www.alcoholics-anonymous.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Alcoholics Anonymous </a>on Wednesday.</p><p>He will say: \"The outdated benefits system fails to get people off drugs and put their lives on track. We have started changing how addicts are supported, but we must go further to actively take on the devastation that drugs and alcohol can cause.</p><p>\"Under universal credit we want to do more to encourage and support claimants into rehabilitation for addiction and starting them on the road to recovery and eventually work. Getting people into work and encouraging independence is our ultimate goal. Universal credit will put people on a journey towards a sustainable recovery so they are better placed to look for work in future and we will be outlining our plans shortly.\"</p><p>It is understood that the work and pensions secretary will not make a formal announcement on Wednesday of the powers that will be handed to Jobcentre Plus staff, but a government source said Duncan Smith believed it was right to give them powers to cut benefits if an addict refused treatment because they could detect signs of trouble.</p><p>The source said: \"The universal credit will allow staff in Jobcentre Plus offices to say: this person has been unemployed for some time. The staff know if people are addicted to alcohol. They know the people they are dealing with.</p><p>\"But we want this to be positive and to be about signposting people to superb organisations that can help them. This is about changing their lives. It is very important to support addicts into the workplace.\"</p><p>But if claimants refuse they will have their benefits docked. \"There will be sanctions,\" the source said, citing cuts to the jobseeker's allowance as an example.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/390559060|2013-10-05T20:57:45Z|fe5d2afa20d2d70dd937151445d861385d082673 -->",

We are changing all of that. <br /> <br />The UK needs a system for family migration underpinned by three simple principles. One: that those who come here should do so on the basis of a genuine relationship. Two: that migrants should be able to pay their way. And three: that they are able to integrate into British society. If you do not meet these requirements, you should not be allowed to come here.</p></blockquote><p>Some Labour MPs complained strongly that the new rules were unfair.

That risk requires the Houses to demand the highest standards of transparency from APGs, both in terms of their funding and the rules on how they present themselves to the media and the wider world.  <br /> <br />Our view is that a degree of reform is needed and will be accepted, indeed welcomed, by Members and Peers.  The recommendations we make would increase the transparency – financial and non-financial – of APG work.  We also make the case for measures which would ensure that parliamentarians establishing, or becoming qualifying members of, APGs fulfil certain additional requirements.  An important principle which underlies our conclusions is that it must be the responsibility of Members and Peers to run APGs, no matter who provides the secretariat.

I think the form of attack they're using against Ed is worse than I had.&quot;</p><p>The peer said he believed Tony Blair did not suffer anything as bad and David Miliband would not have been subject to the same sort of attacks if he had been Labour leader instead of his brother.</p><p>Kinnock said: &quot;Paul Dacre once complained that I hadn't even gone to lunch with him&quot; during his time in opposition. And I said to my people in the office, when they mentioned this, I said the only purpose of going to lunch with Paul Dacre is for him to see if I could hold my knife and fork properly.&quot; He said Miliband was right not to simply &quot;rise above&quot; the whole affair because the press could then have portrayed him as weak for failing to stand up for his father.</p><p>Miliband on Friday attempted to partially draw a line under the affair by saying he has &quot;had his say&quot; by writing to Lord Rothermere, the owner of the Mail newspapers, to call for an inquiry into the culture and practices of the titles.</p><p>The Labour leader said he did not want to pick a fight with the newspaper group and did not believe the article has antisemitic implications, but he wanted to stand up for other families who have suffered similar treatment.</p><p>&quot;I don't think this is just an isolated incident that has just happened to my family and, frankly, I'm interested in the many other families who are not in public life who have had similar experiences,&quot; he told BBC Radio 5 Live.</p><p>Rothermere sent a private letter to Miliband on Thursday expressing regret at the intrusion at the memorial service, but rejected claims that the incident reflected a wider problem with the culture and ethics at his papers. Earlier, Mail on Sunday editor, Geordie Greig, who has been seen as a candidate to succeed Paul Dacre as Daily Mail editor issued his own unreserved apology for the intrusion.</p><p>Before his Channel 4 appearance, Brummer told Radio 4 that the newspaper was the injured party. He said he had been asked by Dacre to rebut the suggestion that the article had any implications of antisemitism. &quot;I think there are people out there who need to apologise to us because there have been vicious accusations in the last couple of days, from Neil Kinnock among others, that somehow this was an antisemitic attack,&quot; he said. Asked why Dacre had not yet appeared in public to explain the piece, Brummer said he preferred to speak through his editorials.</p><p>Politicians including deputy prime minister Nick Clegg and Lord Moore, a former member of Lady Thatcher's cabinet, have condemned the Daily Mail's coverage. More than 700 people have complained to the Press Complaints Commission.</p><p>Lord Glasman, a senior Labour figure, compared the attack on Ralph Miliband to the McCarthyite hunting of communists in the US in the 1950s.</p><p>However, a number of senior Tories stood up for the Mail's right to publish the story about Ralph Miliband, with some saying it should not be used as an excuse to curb press freedom.</p><p>George Jones, an adviser to the Leveson inquiry and former Daily Telegraph political editor, said he thought Miliband &quot;does have an agenda here&quot; beyond his right to defend his father. He told the BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: &quot;If he's trying to broaden this into an attack on the press, and an attack on the newspapers, I think he is misguided.&quot;</p><p>John Whittingdale, the Conservative chairman of the Commons media select committee, said newspapers should be allowed to debate the issue of Ralph Miliband's political views, while Chris Grayling, the Tory justice secretary, said he understood why Miliband was upset but warned: &quot;We have got a free press. If you're in the public eye, you are bound to be subject to scrutiny.&quot;</p><p>Eight Liberal Democrat and Conservative ministers are considering the industry's proposal for newspaper controls through a royal charter, and the issue is expected to be debated by the privy council on Wednesday. If the proposals are dismissed, the privy council may then approve the royal charter backed by the three major political parties but rejected by some elements of the press.</p><p>Grant Shapps, the Tory party chairman, said he was disappointed that there was not similar outrage about a <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/apr/20/cameron-family-tax-havens\" title=\"Guardian story \">Guardian story </a>reporting on the legal offshore investment funds of David Cameron's late father.

    "body":"<p>The Daily Mail's blistering attack on Ed Miliband's late father has again seriously damaged relations between the press and parliament, senior figures in the media fear – days before a crucial meeting on industry regulation.</p><p>The level of ill feeling it has provoked showed no sign of abating on Wedneday. It could result in the revival of the Labour party's rapid rebuttal unit operation set up under Tony Blair to ensure no perceived inaccuracy or piece of negative spin goes unanswered.</p><p>The Daily Mail's controversial profile of Ralph Miliband, which claimed he \"hated Britain\", comes before a pivotal meeting of MPs next Wednesday on press regulation. They will consider proposals for a press royal charter with new press regulator to replace the Press Complaints Commission backed by the country's largest newspaper groups, including the Mail publisher, Associated Newspapers, News UK, owner of the Sun and Times, Telegraph Media Group and Trinity Mirror.</p><p>Chris Blackhurst, group content director of the Independent titles and London Evening Standard, said he believed the episode had \"deepened the schism\" between politicians and press and that the industry's proposals would be rejected.</p><p>\"I would hope that one story and the reaction to that story would not cloud such an important discussion on the future of press freedom,\" he said. \"I don't see how it's helped us [the industry] although it shouldn't really be a negative. You have to bear in mind that the MPs involved in these discussions are only human.\"</p><p>George Eustice MP, the prime minister's energy adviser and a former head of press for the Conservative party, said: \"While the Daily Mail is entitled to voice an opinion, this particular attack was ill-judged and alienated their own readers.\"</p><p>Sources at News UK insisted the acrimony provoked by the article would not derail the process. \"It's not an argument for putting a free press in a mature democracy at the mercy of politicians,\" said a senior executive in reference to the government's rival plan to introduce a form of press regulation backed by royal charter.</p><p>Another senior executive involved in talks to set up a new press regulator pointed out that neither the industry's proposal nor the plan backed by the three main political parties and Hacked Off, the group that campaigns on behalf of victims of media intrusion, could prevent newspapers commenting on politicians.</p><p>An executive at another newspaper group took a different view: \"It comes to something when you can unite Cameron, Clegg and Miliband in just a matter of hours. Anybody who has a dog in the fight will now be able to say that the press royal charter must now be rejected. This is an example of how out of control they are.</p><p>\"Before this we were expecting next week to come and go with nothing happening. Now we don't think that's likely. They may well reject our proposals.\"</p><p>Another editor suggested it could all be a move by Mail editor-in-chief Paul Dacre to get his attack in before the press proposals are rejected. \"He has form. He did this with his attack on David Bell, one of the advisers to the Leveson inquiry, just days before the report came out.\"</p><p>On Wednesday night, as the heat refused to come out of the row, Labour supporter Lord Sugar weighed in, saying David Cameron and Nick Clegg should join Ed Miliband \"in demanding that the Daily Mail shareholders, finally for once and for all, get rid of this man Dacre. He is a tyrant and he needs to be expelled from the newspaper.\"</p><p>There were also voices on the right of the political spectrum who were critical of Dacre including Lord Moore, a former member of Lady Thatcher's cabinet, the former deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine, and Charles Moore, a former editor of the Daily Telegraph. The saga has led to 384 complaints to the Press Complaints Commission and a stream of hostility towards the Daily Mail on Twitter.</p><p>Insiders say the original article on Ralph Miliband headlined \"The Man who Hated Britain\" would have gone largely unnoticed were it not for the paper's vituperative reaction to Miliband's request for a right to reply.</p><p>It is not just press regulation that is at stake. Lance Price, a former spin doctor to Tony Blair when he was prime minister, said it was almost unheard of for the Mail to allow such a lengthy right of reply – but warned that the row would not be forgotten by the paper ahead of the 2015 general election. \"The Mail will certainly remember it. What he has done is open up a debate about the Mail and you can be certain there will be more of this [hostility towards Miliband],\" he said.</p><p>\"The Mail's opposition in 2015 was always going to be off the scale. This has sent them further. When I worked for Blair, we monitored their coverage and made an issue of their journalism – which they used to hate – but that needs to be done.\"</p><p>Damian McBride, the former spin doctor to Gordon Brown who worked with Miliband closely at the Treasury, said it was \"certainly brave and not without risk\" for him to take on the Mail. \"He almost certainly does have significant public support on this, but the danger is in taking social media as a reading on how the public feel generally about newspapers,\" he said.</p><p>\"He should take it out of the Mail and make it more of an issue of how we do our politics in Britain and elevate it to that level. The more it becomes a war the more it is corrosive because it is very difficult to restore those relationships.\"</p><p>Miliband was with his mother, Marion, when an adviser telephoned to say the Mail had published the piece. His mother is said to have urged him to tell people that her husband – a refugee who fled occupied Belgium during the second world war – could have taken the family to live in America, but stayed in England because he loved the country.</p><p>The Labour leader called his brother David in New York and his wife, Justine Thornton, and made clear the attack could not go unanswered. On Saturday evening, Miliband telephoned Daily Mail deputy editor, Jon Steafel, who said the paper would consider running a reply, which was then published on Tuesday.</p><p>Charles Moore, who is the official biographer of Thatcher, writes in this week's Spectator magazine: \"The Mail managed to offend against taste and decency on multiple counts – attacking a man for his deceased father's views, misrepresenting those views, attacking a Jew, attacking a refugee from Hitler.\"</p><p><em>• This article was amended on 3 October 2013 to make clear that the government's plan is for a form of press regulation backed by royal charter</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418890395|2013-10-05T21:00:08Z|6759598ae7d128134d250a6810cd8ef0a90db340 -->",

The proposal is still at a very early stage and the official party briefing shows that there is no detail yet about how this would work. (It is not even clear that they expected this to receive as much media attention as it is receiving.) Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, is already reviewing training options for young people and firm proposals will emerge from this study. A fully-fledged &quot;no dole for the under-25s - just earning or leaning&quot; scheme could be hugely expensive.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24358392\">• Cameron has said the Conservatives want to create a &quot;land of opportunity for all&quot;.</a> He accused Labour of offering a return to &quot;1970s-style socialism&quot; and, stressing the Conservative commitment to enterprise, said that&nbsp;the economy was &quot;turning the corner&quot; and the &quot;land of hope is Tory&quot;.</p> <p>That's all from me for today.

As he discussed his plan to make youngsters either earn or lean, he sounded like the pushy parent, father of the nation. He argued that he wouldn’t accept his own kids sitting around on the dole, so why should he accept any kids doing that. He even got the conference to clap social workers.</p> <p>Perhaps, the weakest area of the speech, though, was on the cost of living. Cameron argued that you couldn’t separate the cost of living from the wider economic debate. But, I suspect, that the Tories are going to need to say more than that. They need something to show that they get it, and that they have policies that will drive down household bills.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/marketsquare/guest/camerons-populism-headache/\">• Mary Ann Sieghart at the Social Market Foundation says the speech sounded tired and unusually reactive.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>David Cameron’s speech sounded as tired as the Prime Minister looked. Apart from a hint towards depriving under-25s of benefit, there were no new policies. If the loyal audience in the hall was bored and underwhelmed, the apathetic public will be even more so. This was a wasted opportunity.</p> <p>For now that Ed Miliband has moved his party decisively to the Left, there is a huge opening for the Tories to capture the vote-winning centre, just as Tony Blair did with New Labour. But Cameron today seemed to have little appetite to entice those middle-ground voters who will have been dismayed by Labour’s performance last week.</p> <p>If anything, the Tory leader looked rattled by the competition. His speech was unusually reactive, fighting Miliband on Labour’s ground. There was a lot of talk about the cost of living, and there was more opposition-bashing than constructive argument. The Conservatives were clearly caught out by Labour’s promise last week to freeze energy bills and don’t yet know how to respond.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-524c17e1e4b0389b327cc253\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-02T13:59:12.297+01:00\">1.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>A senior Conservative party source wants to clarify some points in the briefing note.

Today it is still possible to leave school, sign on, find a flat, start claiming housing benefit and opt for a life on benefits. It’s time for bold action here. We should ask, as we write our next manifesto, if that option should really exist at all. Instead we should give young people a clear, positive choice: Go to school. Go to college. Do an apprenticeship. Get a job. But just choose the dole? We’ve got to offer them something better than that.&quot;</p> <p>Today's announcement&nbsp;builds on the PM's speech at last year's conference when he raised the prospect of stopping housing benefit for under 25s.</p> <p>&nbsp;In his 2012 conference speech, David Cameron said: 'we’re going to look at ending automatic access to housing benefit for people under 25 too'.</p> <p>An existing&nbsp;review&nbsp;being led by Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood is looking at training and education for under-25s and will feed into this policy. The Heywood review is also looking at reforms to support young people while they are in training.</p> <p>Under existing rules, young jobless people lose their benefits if they train for more than 16 hours a week. As a result, the system pays them if they are not in training - but stops supporting them when they do and the Heywood review is looking at ways to support young people after they've commenced training programmes. Those who refuse to take part in the scheme [this means the proposed scheme, an official has just clarified] will lose automatic entitlement to some benefits including job seekers' allowance and housing benefit.</p> <p>This policy is a bringing together of Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Gove's ground-breaking welfare and education policies with making work pay and getting the education and skills necessary to prosper in life. A fully fleshed out version will be in the Conservative party manifesto - and&nbsp;further details will be set out in due course.</p> </blockquote> <p>Normally I do not post briefing notes like this because they are long and detailed.

UCU pointed to recent research from Comres, which showed that 88% of young people want to work or study, and said a new approach to tackling the problem is required at both national and local level.</p> <p>&nbsp;The union said the demonisation of young people as lazy and any restriction of benefits as a way to force young people into low paying temporary jobs or inadequate training&nbsp;would not solve the problem. </p> <p>UCU general secretary, Sally Hunt, said: “We must move beyond glib and superficial analysis of youth unemployment and its causes if we are to give the next generation a real chance in life. Educational underachievement costs the UK economy an estimated &pound;22bn a year.

It requires a strong Government, with a clear mandate, that is accountable for what it promises and yes, what it delivers. And let me tell everyone here what that means. When the election comes, we won’t be campaigning for a coalition... ...we will be fighting heart and soul for a majority Conservative Government – because that is what our country needs.</p> </blockquote> <p>And he ended with a nice story about trees.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You don’t do this job to be popular. You do it because you love your country. I do the best I can. And for me, it comes back to some simple things. Country first. Do what’s decent. Think long-term. There’s an old story that’s told about a great hall in Oxford, near my constituency.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;For hundreds of years it’s stood there – held up with vast oak beams. In the 19th century, those beams needed replacing. And you know what they found? 500 years before, someone had thought… those beams will need replacing one day… …so they planted some oak trees. Just think about that.</p> <p>Centuries had passed… Columbus had reached America… Gravity had been discovered… …and when those oaks were needed, they were ready. Margaret Thatcher once said: “We are in the business of planting trees for our children and grandchildren or we have no business being in politics at all.<strong>”</strong> That is what we are doing today. Not just making do and mending… …but making something better.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p>And here's his peroration.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We’ve got a year and a half ‘til that election... …a year and a half until Britain makes a choice: move forward to something better or go back to something worse… …but I believe that if this party fights with all we have, then this country will make the right choice.</p> <p>Because we always have before.

It’s time for bold action here. We should ask, as we write our next manifesto, if that option should really exist at all. </p> <p>Instead we should give young people a clear, positive choice: Go to school. Go to college. Do an apprenticeship. Get a job. But just choose the dole? We’ve got to offer them something better than that. </p> <p>And let no one paint ideas like this as callous. Think about it: with your children, would you dream of just leaving them to their own devices, not getting a job, not training, nothing?</p> <p>&nbsp;No – you’d nag and push and guide and do anything to get them on their way… and so must we. So this is what we want to see: everyone under 25 – earning or learning. And you know – on this, as on everything else, Labour will fight us... …but remember: we are giving people real opportunities. </p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-524bf111e4b01af934c31025\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-02T11:52:48.134+01:00\">11.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Immigration</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Cameron turns to the link between welfare and immigration.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As Boris said in that great speech yesterday, the problems in our welfare system and the problems in our immigration system are inextricably linked.

But wishing for something, caring about something - that’s not enough. You can’t conjure up a dynamic economy, a strong society, fantastic schools all with the stroke of a minister’s pen. It takes a mixture of hard work, common sense and – above all – the right values.</p> <p>When the left say: you can’t expect too much from the poorest kids; don’t ask too much from people on welfare; business is the problem, not the solution…</p> <p>Here in this party we say: that’s just wrong. If you expect nothing of people that does nothing for them. Yes, you must help people – but you help people by putting up ladders that they can climb through their own efforts. You don’t help children succeed by dumbing down education… ...you help them by pushing them hard. Good education is not about equality of outcomes but bringing the best out of every single child.</p> <p>You don’t help people by leaving them stuck on welfare… ...but by helping them stand on their own two feet. Why? Because the best way out of poverty is work – and the dignity that brings.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-524bed68e4b0b0de6fa99d0d\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-02T11:29:56.744+01:00\">11.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Land of opportunity</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So it makes no difference whether you live in the North or in the South, whether you’re black or you’re white, a man or a woman, the school you went to, the background you have, who your parents were… ...what matters is the effort you put in, and if you put the effort in you’ll have the chance to make it.

Here are 10 things we've learnt.</p> <p><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Compassionate Conservatism has been replaced with Core Conservatism.</strong>&nbsp;It is not so much that the party has shifted to the right (although it certainly has not shifted to the left) as that it has shrunk to its core. What we've had all week is lowest common denominator Conservatism, or Conservatism Redux. In the 2005 general election Lynton Crosby boiled down the Conservative message to 10 words (more police, cleaner hospitals, lower taxes, school discipline, controlled immigration). This week the conference slogan has consisted of 19 words (a tax cut for 25m people, the deficit down, more private sector jobs, welfare capped, crime down, immigration down), but really it's just the economy, spending, welfare and immigration. Everything else that used to be party of David Cameron's Conservatism, including decentralisation and the Big Society, has been marginalised.</p> <p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Cameron has given up trying to attract support from a new cohort of voters.</strong>&nbsp;To win a majority in 2015 Cameron is going to need to get people to vote Conservative who did not in 2010, but it is hard to identify anything announced this week designed to widen the appeal of the party.<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/02/david-cameron-conservative-conference-speech\"> A group called Renewal</a> is actively encouraging Cameron to do this, and earlier this year it published <a href=\"http://www.renewalgroup.org.uk/Access_All_Areas_v1.0.pdf\">an impressive collection of policy proposals (pdf).</a> But, apart from action on fuel duty, most of its proposals have been ignored, and some of what we've heard this week – for example, the harsh anti-union rhetoric – runs directly counter to the Renewal agenda.</p> <p><strong>3. Cameron has (temporarily) united his party over Europe.</strong>&nbsp;For the best party of two decades Conservative conferences were marked by some sort of friction over Europe, normally on the fringe, but sometimes in the conference hall itself. But there has been none of that this year because Cameron's Europe speech in January, and his commitment to a referendum, has given the party a position behind which it can unite. But it won't last, of course, because when the party finally does have to choose between in and out, a split of some kind is inevitable.</p> <p><strong>4. The Conservatives seem to have no idea how to revive their party as a membership organisation</strong>. All the large parties are having problems in this respect, partly because it is hard to see what function mass membership political parties have in the 21st century. But Labour are trying to revive their party through community organising, and the Lib Dems too have a strong commitment to community politics. Some Tory activists and MPs have been floating ideas to breathe life into their party (see, for example, <a href=\"http://www.renewalgroup.org.uk/Access_All_Areas_v1.0.pdf\">the essays from Douglas Carswell and others in the Renewal document,</a> or<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/29/conservative-conference-opens-and-david-camerons-interview-with-andrew-marr-politics-live-blog#block-524814c5e4b0f2e0c75437e2\"> the Bow Group's call for conference to vote on policy) </a>but we have not seen any evidence in Manchester to suggest the party leadership is seriously addressing this problem.</p> <p><strong>5. Even if the Conservatives and the Lib Dems win exactly the same number of seats in 2015 as they did in 2010 (which they won't), creating a second coalition will be much harder.&nbsp;</strong>Partly that's because the parties are moving further apart on policy. Tory localism and Tory liberalism – two strands of thinking in the party that appealed to the Lib Dems – have been sidelined (see 1 above), and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/29/conservative-conference-opens-and-david-camerons-interview-with-andrew-marr-politics-live-blog#block-5247f5c0e4b008dd84fc96f7\">Cameron has signalled that opposing a mansion tax could be a red line in coalition negotiations. </a>And partly because the party leadership has now admitted that Tory MPs would have to have a proper vote on a coalition agreement. (In 2010 they were effectively bounced into backing it.)</p> <p><strong>6.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Boris Johnson has suspended hostilities in his war of attrition against Cameron – and will probably return to the Commons in 2015.</strong> Matthew d'Ancona, author of In It Together, a new book on the coalition, says Cameron and Johnson have been edging towards a deal that will see Cameron backing Johnson's return to the Commons before his term as London's mayor ends in 2016. In return, Johnson seems to have agreed to be more supportive towards Cameron than he has been in the past. Quite what they have said to each other in private remains a mystery, but this week Cameron has for the first time said publicly he would like to see Johnson re-elected to the Commons in 2015 and Johnson has been on his best behaviour (to the disappointment of the media).</p> <p><strong>7.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Fuel duty has joined the list of taxes that are now of limited usefulness because they are incapable of being raised.</strong> George Osborne's announcement that he is going to freeze fuel duty until 2015 was presented as a generous concession, but in reality it was an admission that raising fuel duty is now just too unpopular to be politically acceptable. The same now applies to council tax, with governments at Westminster and in Scotland concluding that they have to do as much as they can to stop it going up. Raising the basic rate of income tax has also been viewed as taboo for at least a generation.</p> <p><strong>8. The Conservatives have finally developed a Ukip strategy.</strong>&nbsp;It has taken a while, but at last the party seems to have got there. <a href=\"%20http:/www.policy-network.net/publications/4357/Democratic-Stress-the-Populist-Signal-and-Extremist-Threat-\">In a Policy Network report earlier this year on how mainstream parties internationally respond to populist, insurgent threats (like Ukip) </a>Anthony Painter identifies three strategies: “hold”, “defuse” and “adopt”. “Hold” (doing nothing and hoping Ukip will go away) did not work, but Cameron has partially chosen “adopt” (he has committed himself to an EU referendum). Mostly, though, he is following “defuse”, doing all he can to limit immigration, because concern about immigration is fuelling Ukip support. Senior Conservatives have now stopped being rude about Ukip supporters and are instead now actively appealing for their votes. <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2013/09/william-hagues-plan-to-reunite-the-right/\">“I think of it as making a pact with the voters of other parties,” William Hague told a fringe meeting.</a></p> <p><strong>9. The Conservatives are not certain that they will benefit economically from economic recovery.</strong> There is a lazy assumption that a growing economy must be good for the incumbent party (partly because the memory of how economic crisis contributed to Labour's defeat in 2010 is still fresh). But historically it does not always work like this and George Osborne's decision to use his speech to stress that recovery is far from over reflects a sense that too much good news could be helpful to Labour. Osborne may recall that Ed Miliband said last year: “In good times people turn to leftwing parties but in bad times they say ‘Leftwing parties can’t necessarily make those tough decisions, we’ll turn to the right.” (Miliband seems to be right. <a href=\"http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-do-we-only-vote-labour-when-times-are-good/9026\">According to this report, Labour has never gained power in an election with growth running at lower than 2%.)</a></p> <p><strong>10.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Two of the most powerful figures during the 2015 election campaign will be Paul Johnson, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24288088\">whoever replaces Stephanie Flanders as economics editor of the BBC.</a></strong> Osborne is betting that, come 2015, his budget surplus plan will offer a more credible and sustainable path to long-term future growth than Labour's alternative. But how are any of us non-economists going to judge who's right? This will be particularly hard because Osborne's new fiscal mandate involves some heroic long-term assumptions. <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2013/09/tory-conference-2013-well-balance-the-books-by-2020-george-osbornes-speech-analysis/\">Fraser Nelson makes this point well at Coffee House:</a> “The economist Nassim Taleb <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/7637843/flight-of-the-black-swan/\">once told me</a> the technical term for five-year economic forecasts: ‘bullshit’. Make no mistake, these are fairytale figures. Economists struggle to project <em>five months</em> ahead, let alone five years.” In 2015 the electorate are going to need help from experts, and Johnson at the IFS and the new Flanders will probably have as much clout as anyone.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-02T12:46:46.064+01:00\">at 12.46pm BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-524be2a7e4b0d2df47effa80\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-02T10:16:46.434+01:00\">10.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bingo!</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Paul Owen</strong> will be moonlighting as a bingo caller throughout David Cameron.

I've inserted the summary lines myself. The dots (ellipses) are from Cameron's text. He likes using them in his speeches.</p> <p><strong>• Cameron will say that he wants Britain to be a &quot;land of opportunity&quot;.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I didn’t come into politics just to fix what went wrong, but to build something right.</p> <p>We in this party – we don’t dream of deficits and decimal points and dry fiscal plans…</p> <p>…our dreams are about helping people get on in life…</p> <p>…aspiration, opportunity…</p> <p>…these are our words, our dreams.</p> <p>&nbsp;So today I want to talk about our one, abiding mission…</p> <p>…I believe it is the great Conservative mission…</p> <p>&nbsp;… that as our economy starts to recover…</p> <p>&nbsp;…we build a land of opportunity in our country today.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• He will say this involves a new approach to the economy, welfare and education.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But finishing the job is about more than clearing up the mess we were left.</p> <p>&nbsp;It means building something better in its place.</p> <p>&nbsp;In place of the casino economy, one where people who work hard can actually get on.</p> <p>&nbsp;In place of the welfare society, one where no individual is written off.</p> <p>&nbsp;In place of the broken education system, one that gives every child the chance to rise up and succeed.</p> <p>Our economy, our society, welfare, schools…</p> <p>...all reformed, all rebuilt - with one aim, one mission in mind.</p> <p>To make this country, at long last and for the first time ever, a land of opportunity for all.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• He will say opportunity should genuinely be open to everyone.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So it makes no difference whether you live in the North or in the South, whether you’re black or you’re white, a man or a woman, the school you went to, the background you have, who your parents were…</p> <p>...what matters is the effort you put in, and if you put the effort in you’ll have the chance to make it.</p> <p>That’s what the land of opportunity means.</p> <p>That’s what finishing the job means.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• He will criticise the left for not expecting enough from people.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of course I know that others in politics may talk about these things.</p> <p>But wishing for something, caring about something - that’s not enough.</p> <p>You can’t conjure up a dynamic economy, a strong society, fantastic schools all with the stroke of a minister’s pen.</p> <p>It takes a mixture of hard work, common sense and – above all – the right values.</p> <p>When the left say: you can’t expect too much from the poorest kids; don’t ask too much from people on welfare; business is the problem, not the solution…</p> <p>…Here in this party we say: that’s just wrong.</p> <p>If you expect nothing of people that does nothing for them.</p> <p>Yes, you must help people – but you help people by putting up ladders that they can climb through their own efforts.</p> <p>You don’t help children succeed by dumbing down education…</p> <p>..you help them by pushing them hard.</p> <p>Good education is not about equality of outcomes but bringing the best out of every single child.</p> <p>You don’t help people by leaving them stuck on welfare…</p> <p>...but by helping them stand on their own two feet.</p> <p>Why? Because the best way out of poverty is work – and the dignity that brings.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• He will say that profit is not a dirty word.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We know that profit, wealth creation, tax cuts, enterprise...</p> <p>&nbsp;...these are not dirty, elitist words – they’re not the problem...</p> <p>&nbsp;...they really are the solution because it’s not government that creates jobs, it’s businesses…</p> <p>&nbsp;…it’s businesses that get wages in people’s pockets, food on their tables, hope for their families and success for our country.</p> <p>&nbsp;There is no shortcut to a land of opportunity. No quick fix. No easy way to do it.</p> <p>&nbsp;You build it business by business, school by school, person by person…</p> <p>&nbsp;...patiently, practically, painstakingly.</p> <p>&nbsp;And under-pinning it all is that deep, instinctive belief that if you trust people and give them the tools, they will succeed.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-524bd2e8e4b0112111159504\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-02T09:12:55.182+01:00\">9.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>David Cameron winds up the Conservative conference today. We've had some briefing overnight on what he's going to say, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/02/david-cameron-conservative-conference-speech\">here's the Guardian preview.</a> And here's how it starts.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>David Cameron will on Wednesday attempt to lay down clear battle lines for the general election, with Labour cast to the left and the Tories occupying the centre right, when he launches a defence of business with a declaration that profit will never be a &quot;dirty, elitist&quot; word under his leadership.</p> <p>In a riposte to Ed Miliband, who alarmed the Tories with his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/24/ed-miliband-labour-freeze-prices-2017\">populist pledge last week to freeze fuel prices</a> for 20 months, the prime minister will warn against &quot;quick fixes&quot; as he seeks to rebuild the economy after the downturn.</p> <p>&quot;There is no shortcut to a land of opportunity,&quot; he will tell the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference\">Conservative conference</a> on its final day in Manchester. &quot;No quick fix. No easy way to do it.&quot;</p> <p>Aides insisted the main focus of the speech is not a point-by-point response to Miliband. Cameron instead wants to outline his positive vision to create a &quot;land of opportunity&quot;, following last year's &quot;aspiration nation&quot; speech. One source said of the two themes at the two consecutive conferences: &quot;They are cousins of each other.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>I'll be covering the speech, and the reaction to it, in depth.</p> <p>Before Cameron speaks, I will also put up a post on 10 things we've learnt from the Conservative conference.</p> <p>Here is the agenda.</p> <p><em>9.15am:</em> Session on the UK, with Theresa Villiers, the Northern Ireland secretary, David Jones, the Welsh secretary, Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, and Andrew Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-24347395\">According to David Cornock on his BBC blog, there was a squabble about who would be there from Wales.</a></p> <p><em>10.30am:</em> Session on the independence referendum battle in Scotland, with Ruth Davidson.</p> <p><em>11am</em>: David Cameron delivers his speech.</p> <p>If you want to follow me on Twitter, I'm on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow</a></p> </div> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418817049|2013-10-05T21:00:08Z|7d671072004c4a9893eab121450e7ea48670f1a5 -->",
